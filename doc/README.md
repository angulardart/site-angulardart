# Welcome to the site-angulardart docs!

These `/doc` pages provide information about the structure and build tasks of
this repo, as well as detailed instructions on how to update the site content --
for example, after a new version of Angular is released.

Some of the content was migrated from this repo's [wiki][], which was originally
copied from the [site-webdev wiki][] -- so pages probably need some updates.
