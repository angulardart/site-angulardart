# Site for _AngularDart_ ([angulardart.dev][])

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dart-lang/site-angulardart.svg?token=ufcxuyv7xRMxuesyaqn3&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dart-lang/site-angulardart)
[![first-timers-only SVG][]][first-timers-only]

The [angulardart.dev][] site, built with [Jekyll][] and hosted on [Firebase Hosting][Firebase].

[We welcome contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md), and we're [first-timer
friendly](http://www.firsttimersonly.com)!

For simple changes (such as to CSS and text), you probably don't need to
build this site. Often you can make changes using the GitHub UI.

If you want/need to build, read on.

## Before you build this site

### 1. Get the prerequisites

Install the following tools if you don't have them already.

- **[nvm][]**, the Node Version Manager.
- **[rvm][]**, the Ruby Version Manager.
- **[Dart][]**
- **[Chrome][]** v63 or later.

> IMPORTANT: Follow the installation instructions for each of the tools
carefully. In particular, configure your shell/environment so
that the tools are available in every terminal/command window you create.

### 2. Clone this repo _and_ its submodule

> NOTE: This repo has a git _submodule_, which affects how you clone it.

To **clone this repo** ([site-angulardart][]), follow the instructions given in the
GitHub help on [Cloning a repository][], and _choose one_ of the following
submodule-cloning techniques:

- Clone this repo and its submodule _at the same_, use the
  `--recurse-submodules` option:<br>
  `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dart-lang/site-angulardart.git`
- If you've already cloned this repo without its submodule, then run
  this command from the repo root:<br>
  `git submodule update --init --remote`

> IMPORTANT:
> Whenever you update your repo, update the submodule as well:<br>
> `git pull; git submodule update --init --remote`

### 3. Run installation scripts

> NOTE: It is safe to (re-)run all of the commands and scripts given below even
if you already have the required packages installed.

**Open a terminal/command window** and execute the following commands:

1. <code>cd <i>\<path-to-angulardart-repo></i></code> &nbsp;&nbsp;# change to
   **root of this repo**, e.g.: `~/git/site-angulardart`
1. `source ./tool/env-set.sh` &nbsp;&nbsp;#
   initialize environment variables; install/use required Node & Ruby version
1. `./tool/before-install.sh` &nbsp;&nbsp;#
   install core set of required tools
1. `./tool/install.sh` &nbsp;&nbsp;#
   install everything else needed to build this site

> IMPORTANT:
> - Any time you create a **new terminal/command window** to work on
>   this repo, **repeat steps 1 and 2** above.
> - If you upgrade Dart then rerun all of the steps above.

## Building this site

Once everything is installed, you need to do a full site build at least once:

- `npx gulp build --dartdoc` &nbsp;&nbsp;# full site build including API docs

The generated site is placed in the `publish` folder. To serve this folder use:

- `npx superstatic --port 4001`

Or, if you aren't testing redirects, use this command (which has the bonus of
autorefreshing your browser after edits):

- `jekyll serve --livereload`

To view the generated site open [localhost:4001](http://localhost:4001/)
in a browser.

You can build, serve, and have a watcher for changes by running the
following command:

- `./tool/serve.sh`

> NOTE: Getting `jekyll | Error:  Too many open files` under MacOS or Linux?
>   One way to resolve this is to add the following to your `.bashrc`:
>
>      ulimit -n 8192
>
>   and then reboot your machine.

If you'd like to separately build and then serve, the commands are:

- `npx gulp build --no-dartdoc` &nbsp;&nbsp;# build site without regenerating
   API docs
- `npx superstatic --port 4001` &nbsp;&nbsp;# serve site under `publish`

Some `npx gulp build` options include:

- `--clean` &nbsp;&nbsp;# deletes `publish` and file fragments (nothing else)
- `--[no-]dartdoc[=all|acx|ng|forms|router|test]` &nbsp;&nbsp;#
  generates API docs for named packages (default `all`)
- `--use-cached-api-doc` &nbsp;&nbsp;# will use cached API docs rather
   than regenerate them; without this option API docs are regenerated
   afresh each time
- `--fast` &nbsp;&nbsp;# skips some one-time setup tasks (can spead
   up repeated builds)
- `--log=x` &nbsp;&nbsp;# logging level: `debug`, `info`, `warn` (default),
   `error`

## Rebuilding this site from scratch

If you encounter build problems, or if you haven't build this site in a while,
you might want to rebuild it from scratch, doing all of the following steps
(in order):

```
source ./tool/env-set.sh  # reset environment vars and (re-)install Node & Ruby
npx gulp clean            # clean out all temporary site folders
npx gulp build --dartdoc  # full site regeneration
./tool/serve.sh
```

If you are still having build problems, you might need to once again step
through the installation instructions.

## Deploying

Deploy to the `default` firebase project (hosting the official site) using this
command:

```
./tool/shared/deploy.sh --robots ok default
```

## Other useful Gulp tasks

```
npx gulp test --filter=template  # unit test only the template-syntax example
npx gulp e2e --filter=template   # end-to-end test only the template-syntax example
npx gulp clean && npx gulp build --dartdoc  # do a full build from a clean slate
npx gulp git-clean-src  # WARNING WARNING WARNING: this runs `git clean -xdf src`,
                        # so you'll lose uncommitted work under `src`!
