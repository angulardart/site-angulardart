# ACX API doc build on pub.dev is failing
# (see https://github.com/dart-lang/site-angulardart/issues/72):
https://pub.dev/documentation/angular_components

# Some ACX API links are being redirected to the gallery, but the gallery often
# doesn't have the corresponding anchors, so ignore those:
https://dart-lang.github.io/angular_components/#

# angular.io is now an Angular app; the link checker has difficulty seeing anchors
# (probably because the page hasn't been fully generated yet), so skip such links:
https://angular.io/.*?#

# Ignore warnings about missing anchors into the live example apps:
http://angular-examples.github.io/[^/]+/?#

# Sites using hash location strategy or anchors instead of query params.
# Hence linkcheck issues a warning about the missing "anchor". Silence these:

# Pub: ignore warnings about missing anchors to pub page tabs.
