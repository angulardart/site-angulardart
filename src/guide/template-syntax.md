This page covers the basic elements of the Angular template syntax for constructing views.

The Angular app manages what the user sees and can do, achieving this through the interaction of a
component class instance (the *component*) and its user-facing template.

You might be familiar with the combination of component and template from experience with model-view-controller (MVC) or model-view-viewmodel (MVVM).
In Angular, the component plays the part of the controller/viewmodel, and the template represents the view.

The {% example_ref %}
demonstrates all of the syntax and code snippets described in this page.

<div class="l-hr"></div>
## HTML in templates  {#html}

HTML is the language of the Angular template.
Almost all HTML syntax is valid template syntax.
The `<script>` element is a notable exception;
it's forbidden, eliminating the risk of script injection attacks.
In practice, `<script>` is ignored and a warning appears in the browser console.
See the [Security](security) page for details.

Some legal HTML doesn't make much sense in a template.
The `<html>`, `<body>`, and `<base>` elements have no useful role.
Pretty much everything else can be used.

You can extend the HTML vocabulary of templates with components and directives that appear as new elements and attributes.
In the following sections, you'll learn how to get and set DOM (Document Object Model) values dynamically through data binding.

Begin with the first form of data binding&mdash;interpolation&mdash;to see how much richer template HTML can be.

<a href="#page-content">back to top</a>
<div class="l-hr"></div>

<div id="interpolation"></div>
## Interpolation ( <span class="syntax">{&#xfeff;{...}}</span> )

You met the double-curly braces of interpolation, `{!{` and `}!}`, early in your Angular education.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (first-interpolation)"?>
```
  <p>My current hero is {!{currentHero.name}!}</p>
```

You use interpolation to weave calculated strings into the text between HTML element tags and within attribute assignments.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html" region="title+image"?>
```
  <h3>
    {!{title}!}
    <img src="{!{heroImageUrl}!}" style="height:30px">
  </h3>
```

The text between the braces is often the name of a component property. Angular replaces that name with the
string value of the corresponding component property. In the example above, Angular evaluates the `title` and `heroImageUrl` properties
and "fills in the blanks", first displaying a bold app title and then a heroic image.

More generally, the text between the braces is a **template expression** that Angular first **evaluates**
and then **converts to a string**. The following interpolation illustrates the point by adding the two numbers:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (sum-1)"?>
```
  <!-- "The sum of 1 + 1 is 2" -->
  <p>The sum of 1 + 1 is {!{1 + 1}!}</p>
```

The expression can invoke methods of the host component such as `getVal()`, seen here:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (sum-2)"?>
```
  <!-- "The sum of 1 + 1 is not 4" -->
  <p>The sum of 1 + 1 is not {!{1 + 1 + getVal()}!}</p>
```

Angular evaluates all expressions in double curly braces,
converts the expression results to strings, and links them with neighboring literal strings. Finally,
it assigns this composite interpolated result to an **element or directive property**.

From a quick glance at the syntax, it looks as if you're inserting the result
between element tags and assigning it to attributes. That's a convenient way to
think of what's happening, but it's not exactly true. Interpolation is a special
syntax that Angular converts into a
[property binding](#property-binding). See the details
[below](#property-binding-or-interpolation).

But first, let's take a closer look at template expressions and statements.

<a href="#page-content">back to top</a>
<div class="l-hr"></div>

## Template expressions

A template **expression** produces a value.
Angular executes the expression and assigns it to a property of a binding target;
the target might be an HTML element, a component, or a directive.

The interpolation braces in `{!{1 + 1}!}` surround the template expression `1 + 1`.
In the [property binding](#property-binding) section below,
a template expression appears in quotes to the right of the&nbsp;`=` symbol, as in `[property]="expression"`.

You write these template expressions in a language that looks like Dart.
Many Dart expressions are legal template expressions, but not all are.

Dart expressions that have or promote side effects are prohibited,
including the following:

* Assignments (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, ...)
* `new` or `const`
* Chaining expressions with `;`
* Increment and decrement operators (`++` and `--`)

Other notable differences from Dart syntax include the following:

* No support for Dart string interpolation; for example,
  instead of `"'The title is $title'"`, you must write
  `"'The title is ' + title"`
* No support for the bitwise operators `|` and `&`
* New [template expression operators](#expression-operators), such as `|`

<a href="#page-content">back to top</a>

### Expression context

The *expression context* is typically the _component_ instance.
In the following snippets, the `title`  within double curly braces and the
`isUnchanged` in quotes refer to properties of the `AppComponent`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (context-component-expression)"?>
```
  {!{title}!}
  <span [hidden]="isUnchanged">changed</span>
```

An expression can also refer to properties of the _template's_ context,
such as a [template input variable](#template-input-variable) (`let hero`)
or a [template reference variable](#ref-vars) (`#heroInput`).

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (context-var)" plaster="none"?>
```
  <div *ngFor="let hero of heroes">{!{hero.name}!}</div>
  <input #heroInput> {!{heroInput.value}!}
```

The context for terms in an expression is a blend of the _template variables_
and the component's _members_.
If you reference a name that belongs to more than one of these namespaces,
the template variable name takes precedence, followed by a name in the directive's _context_,
and, lastly, the component's member names.

The previous example presents such a name collision. The component has a `hero`
property and the `*ngFor` defines a `hero` template variable.
The `hero` in `{% raw %}{{hero.name}}{% endraw %}`
refers to the template input variable, not the component's property.

Template expressions can refer to top-level and static-member constants and
functions that are listed in a component's `exports` argument.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.dart (exports)" replace="/exports:.*/[!$&!]/g"?>
```
  import 'dart:math' as math;
  // ···
  enum Color { red, green, blue }
  // ···
  @Component(
    // ···
    [!exports: [Color, math.min],!]
    // ···
  )
  class AppComponent implements OnInit {
    // ···
  }
```

Access members of exported enums using the usual syntax:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (enums)" retain="Color."?>
```
  The name of the Color.red enum is {!{Color.red}!}.<br>
```

<a href="#page-content">back to top</a>

<div id="no-side-effects"></div>
### Expression guidelines

Template expressions can make or break an app.
Follow these guidelines:

* [No visible side effects](#no-visible-side-effects)
* [Quick execution](#quick-execution)
* [Simplicity](#simplicity)
* [Idempotence](#idempotence)

If you make an exception to the above guidelines, make sure you thoroughly
understand the circumstances.

#### No visible side effects

A template expression must not change any app state other than the value of the
target property.

This rule is essential to Angular's "unidirectional data flow" policy.
It ensures that reading a component value doesn't change some other displayed
value. The view must be stable throughout a single rendering pass.

#### Quick execution

Angular executes template expressions after every change detection cycle.
Change detection cycles are triggered by many asynchronous activities such as
promise resolutions, http results, timer events, keypresses and mouse moves.

Expressions need to finish quickly or the user experience might drag, especially on slower devices.
Consider caching values when their computation is expensive.

#### Simplicity

Although it's possible to write quite complex template expressions, it's best to avoid them.

In most situations, use a property name or method call.
An occasional Boolean negation (`!`) is OK.
Otherwise, confine application and business logic to the component itself,
where it's easier to develop and test.

#### Idempotence

An [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) expression is ideal because
it's free of side effects and improves Angular's change detection performance.

In Angular terms, an idempotent expression always returns *exactly the same thing* until
one of its dependent values changes.

Dependent values should not change during a single turn of the event loop.
If an idempotent expression returns a string or a number, it returns the same string or number
when called twice in a row. If the expression returns an object (including a `List`),
it returns the same object *reference* when called twice in a row.

<a href="#page-content">back to top</a>
<div class="l-hr"></div>

## Template statements

A template **statement** responds to an **event** raised by a binding target
such as an element, component, or directive.
You'll see template statements in the [event binding](#event-binding) section
appearing in quotes to the right of the `=`&nbsp;symbol as in `(event)="statement"`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (context-component-statement)"?>
```
  <button (click)="deleteHero()">Delete hero</button>
```

A template statement *has a side effect*.
That's the whole point of an event.
It's how you update app state from user action.

Responding to events is the other side of Angular's "unidirectional data flow".
You're free to change anything, anywhere, during this turn of the event loop.

Like template expressions, template *statements* use a language that looks like Dart.
The template statement parser differs from the template expression parser and
specifically supports both basic assignment (`=`) and chaining expressions
(with `;`).

However, the following Dart syntax is not allowed:

* `new` or `const`
* Increment and decrement operators, `++` and `--`
* Operator assignment, such as `+=` and `-=`
* The bitwise operators `|` and `&`
* The [template expression operators](#expression-operators)

### Statement context

As with expressions, statements can refer only to what's in the statement context
such as an event handling method of the component instance.

The *statement context* is typically the component instance.
The *deleteHero* in `(click)="deleteHero()"` is a method of the data-bound component.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (context-component-statement)"?>
```
  <button (click)="deleteHero()">Delete hero</button>
```

The statement context can also refer to properties of the template's own context.
In the following examples, the template `$event` object,
a [template input variable](#template-input-variable) (`let hero`),
and a [template reference variable](#ref-vars) (`#heroForm`)
are passed to an event handling method of the component.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (context-var-statement)" plaster="none"?>
```
  <button (click)="onSave($event)">Save</button>
  <button *ngFor="let hero of heroes" (click)="deleteHero(hero)">{!{hero.name}!}</button>
  <form #heroForm (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(heroForm)"> ... </form>
```

Template context names take precedence over component context names.
In `deleteHero(hero)` above, the `hero` is the template input variable,
not the component's `hero` property.

Template statements can refer to top-level and static-member constants and
functions that are listed in a component's `exports` argument.
For details, see the discussion of `exports` in the section on
[Expression context](#expression-context).

### Statement guidelines

As with expressions, avoid writing complex template statements.
Method calls or simple property assignments are best.

Now that you have a feel for template expressions and statements,
you're ready to learn about the varieties of data binding syntax beyond interpolation.

<a href="#page-content">back to top</a>
<div class="l-hr"></div>

## Binding syntax: An overview  {#binding-syntax}

Data binding is a mechanism for coordinating what users see, with app data values.
While you can push values to and pull values from HTML,
the app is easier to write, read, and maintain if you use a binding framework.
You declare bindings between binding sources and target HTML elements and then let the framework do the work.

Below is a high-level summary of Angular data binding and its syntax. It's
followed by more detailed information about most of the data binding types that
Angular provides.

Binding types can be grouped into three categories based on the direction of
data flow: _source-to-view_, _view-to-source_, and two-way sequence
_view-to-source-to-view_.

{% comment %}Dart gives the best code styling results for the fenced code in the table.{% endcomment %}
<table width="100%">
  <col width="30%"> <col width="50%"> <col width="20%">
  <tr> <th>Data direction</th> <th>Syntax</th> <th>Type</th> </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>One-way<br>from data source<br>to view target</td>
  <td markdown="1">
  ```dart
  {!{expression}!}
  [target]="expression"
  bind-target="expression"
  ```
  </td>
  <td>Interpolation<br>Property<br>Attribute<br>Class<br>Style</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>One-way<br>from view target<br>to data source</td>
  <td markdown="1">
  ```dart
  (target)="statement"
  on-target="statement"
  ```
  </td>
  <td>Event</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Two-way</td>
  <td markdown="1">
  ```dart
  [(target)]="expression"
  ```
  </td>
  <td>Two-way</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Binding types other than interpolation have a **target name** to the left of the equal sign,
either surrounded by punctuation (`[]`, `()`, `[()]`) or preceded by a prefix (`bind-`, `on-`).

The target name is the name of a _property_. It might look like the name of an _attribute_ but it never is.
To appreciate the difference, you must develop a new way to think about template HTML.

### A new mental model

With all the power of data binding and the ability to extend the HTML vocabulary
with custom markup, it's tempting to think of template HTML as *HTML Plus*.

It really *is* HTML Plus.
But it's also significantly different from the HTML you're used to.
It requires a new mental model.

In the normal course of HTML development, you create a visual structure with HTML elements, and
you modify those elements by setting element attributes with string constants.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html" region="img+button"?>
```
  <div class="special">Mental Model</div>
  <img src="assets/images/hero.png">
  <button disabled>Save</button>
```

You still create a structure and initialize attribute values this way in Angular templates.

Then you learn to create new elements with components that encapsulate HTML
and drop them into templates as if they were native HTML elements.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (my-hero-1)"?>
```
  <!-- Normal HTML -->
  <div class="special">Mental Model</div>
  <!-- Wow! A new element! -->
  <my-hero></my-hero>
```

That's HTML Plus.

Then you learn about data binding. The first binding you meet might look like this:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (disabled-button-1)"?>
```
  <!-- Bind button disabled state to `isUnchanged` property -->
  <button [disabled]="isUnchanged">Save</button>
```

Your intuition might suggest that you're binding to the button's `disabled` attribute and setting
it to the current value of the component's `isUnchanged` property. That intuition would be incorrect!

The everyday HTML mental model is misleading. Once you start data
binding, you're no longer working with HTML *attributes*. You aren't setting
attributes; you're setting the *properties* of DOM elements, components, and
directives.

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
### HTML attribute vs. DOM property

  The distinction between an HTML attribute and a DOM property is crucial to understanding how Angular binding works.

  **Attributes are defined by HTML. Properties are defined by the DOM (Document Object Model).**

  * A few HTML attributes have 1:1 mapping to properties. `id` is one example.

  * Some HTML attributes don't have corresponding properties. `colspan` is one example.

  * Some DOM properties don't have corresponding attributes. `textContent` is one example.

  * Many HTML attributes appear to map to properties ... but not in the way you might think!

  That last category is confusing unless you know this general rule:

  **Attributes *initialize* DOM properties and then they're done.
  Property values can change; attribute values can't.**

  For example, when the browser renders `<input type="text" value="Bob">`, it creates a
  corresponding DOM node with a `value` property *initialized* to "Bob".

  When the user enters "Sally" in the input box, the DOM element `value` *property* becomes "Sally".
  But the HTML `value` *attribute* remains unchanged, as you discover if you ask the input element
  about that attribute: `input.getAttribute('value')` returns "Bob".

  The HTML attribute `value` specifies the *initial* value; the DOM `value` property is the *current* value.

  The `disabled` attribute is another peculiar example. A button's `disabled` *property* is
  `false` by default so the button is enabled.
  When you add the `disabled` *attribute*, its presence alone initializes the  button's `disabled` *property* to `true`
  so the button is disabled.

  Adding and removing the `disabled` *attribute* disables and enables the button. The value of the *attribute* is irrelevant,
  which is why you can't enable a button by writing `<button disabled="false">Still Disabled</button>`.

  Setting the button's `disabled` *property*  (say, with an Angular binding) disables or enables the button.
  The value of the *property* matters.

  **The HTML attribute and the DOM property are not the same thing, even when they have the same name.**
</div>

This fact bears repeating:
**Template binding works with *properties* and *events*, not *attributes*.**

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  <h4>A world without attributes</h4>
  In the world of Angular, the only role of attributes is to initialize element and directive state.
  When you write a data binding, you're dealing exclusively with properties and events of the target object.
  HTML attributes effectively disappear.
</div>

With this model in mind, read on to learn about binding targets.

### Binding targets

The **target of a data binding** is something in the DOM.
Depending on the binding type, the target can be an
(element | component | directive) property, an
(element | component | directive) event, or (rarely) an attribute name.
The following table summarizes the scenarios:

<table>
<col width="10%"> <col width="15%"> <col width="75%">
<tr> <th>Type</th> <th>Target</th> <th>Examples</th> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>Property</td>
  <td>Element&nbsp;property<br>Component&nbsp;property<br>Directive&nbsp;property</td>
  <td markdown="1">
  <?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (property-binding-syntax-1)"?>
  ```
    <img [src]="heroImageUrl">
    <my-hero [hero]="currentHero"></my-hero>
    <div [ngClass]="{'special': isSpecial}">...</div>
  ```
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Event</td>
  <td>Element&nbsp;event<br>Component&nbsp;event<br>Directive&nbsp;event</td>
  <td markdown="1">
  <?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (event-binding-syntax-1)"?>
  ```
    <button (click)="onSave()">Save</button>
    <my-hero (deleteRequest)="deleteHero()"></my-hero>
    <div (myClick)="clicked=$event" clickable>click me</div>
  ```
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Two-way</td>
  <td>Event and property</td>
  <td markdown="1">
  <?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (2-way-binding-syntax-1)"?>
  ```
    <input [(ngModel)]="name">
  ```
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Attribute</td>
  <td>Attribute (the&nbsp;exception)</td>
  <td markdown="1">
  <?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (attribute-binding-syntax-1)"?>
  ```
    <button [attr.aria-label]="help">help</button>
  ```
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Class</td>
  <td><code>class</code> property</td>
  <td markdown="1">
  <?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (class-binding-syntax-1)"?>
  ```
    <div [class.special]="isSpecial">Special</div>
  ```
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Style</td>
  <td><code>style</code> property</td>
  <td markdown="1">
  <?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (style-binding-syntax-1)"?>
  ```
    <button [style.color]="isSpecial ? 'red' : 'green'">
  ```
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

You're now ready to look at binding types in detail.

<a href="#page-content">back to top</a>
<div class="l-hr"></div>

## Property binding ( <span class="syntax">[property]</span> ) {#property-binding}

Write a template **property binding** to set a property of a view element.
The binding sets the property to the value of a [template expression](#template-expressions).

The most common property binding sets an element property to a component property value. An example is
binding the `src` property of an image element to a component's `heroImageUrl` property:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (property-binding-1)"?>
```
  <img [src]="heroImageUrl">
```

Another example is disabling a button when the component says that it `isUnchanged`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (property-binding-2)"?>
```
  <button [disabled]="isUnchanged">Cancel is disabled</button>
```

Another is setting a property of a directive:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (property-binding-3)"?>
```
  <div [ngClass]="classes">[ngClass] binding to the classes property</div>
```

Yet another is setting the model property of a custom component (a great way
for parent and child components to communicate):

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (property-binding-4)"?>
```
  <my-hero [hero]="currentHero"></my-hero>
```

### One-way *in*

People often describe property binding as *one-way data binding* because it flows a value in one direction,
from a component's data property into a target element property.

You can't use property binding to pull values *out* of the target element.
You can't bind to a property of the target element to _read_ it.; you can only _set_ it.

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  Similarly, you can't use property binding to *call* a method on the target element.

  If the element raises events, you can listen to them with an [event binding](#event-binding).

  If you must read a target element property or call one of its methods,
  you need a different technique.
  See the API reference for
  [ViewChild]({{site.pub-api}}/angular/{{site.data.pkg-vers.angular.vers}}/angular/ViewChild-class.html) and
  [ContentChild]({{site.pub-api}}/angular/{{site.data.pkg-vers.angular.vers}}/angular/ContentChild-class.html).
</div>

### Binding target

An element property between enclosing square brackets identifies the target property.
The target property in the following code is the image element's `src` property.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (property-binding-1)"?>
```
  <img [src]="heroImageUrl">
```

Some people prefer the `bind-` prefix alternative, known as the *canonical form*:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (property-binding-5)"?>
```
  <img bind-src="heroImageUrl">
```

The target name is always the name of a property, even when it appears to be the name of something else.
You might see `src` and think it's the name of an attribute. It's not; it's the name of an image element property.

Element properties might be the more common targets,
but Angular looks first to see if the name is a property of a known directive,
as it is in the following example:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (property-binding-3)"?>
```
  <div [ngClass]="classes">[ngClass] binding to the classes property</div>
```

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  Technically, Angular is matching the name to a directive [input](#inputs-outputs)
  or a property decorated with `@Input()`. Such inputs map to the directive's own properties.
</div>

If the name fails to match a property of a known directive or element, Angular reports an “unknown directive” error.

### Avoid side effects

As mentioned previously, the evaluation of a template expression must have no visible side effects.
The expression language itself does its part to keep you safe.
You can't assign a value to anything in a property binding expression nor use the increment and decrement operators.

Of course, the expression might invoke a property or method that has side effects.
Angular has no way of knowing that or stopping you.

The expression could call something like `getFoo()`. Only you know what `getFoo()` does.
If `getFoo()` changes something and you happen to be binding to that something, you risk an unpleasant experience.
Angular may or may not display the changed value. Angular may detect the change and throw a warning error.
In general, stick to data properties and to methods that return values and do no more.

### Return the proper type

The template expression should evaluate to the type of value expected by the target property.
The `hero` property of `HeroComponent` expects a `Hero` object, which is exactly what you're sending in the property binding:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (property-binding-4)"?>
```
  <my-hero [hero]="currentHero"></my-hero>
```

### Remember the brackets

The brackets tell Angular to evaluate the template expression.
If you omit the brackets, Angular treats the string as a constant
and *initializes the target property* with that string.
It does *not* evaluate the string!

If you forget the brackets around the `hero` property like this:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (property-binding-6)" remove="--" replace="/DON'T.*/[!\x3C-- $& --\x3E!]/g"?>
```
  [!<-- DON'T do this: -->!]
  <my-hero hero="currentHero"></my-hero>
```

You'll get the following build error:

```console
[error] A value of type 'String' can't be assigned to a variable of type 'Hero'.
```

### One-time string initialization {#one-time-initialization}

Omit the brackets when all of the following are true:
* The target property accepts a string value.
* The string is a fixed value that you can bake into the template.
* This initial value never changes.

One-time string initialization is routine in standard HTML, and
it works just as well for directive and component properties.
The following example initializes the `prefix` property of the `HeroComponent` to a fixed string,
not a template expression. Angular sets it and forgets about it.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (property-binding-7)"?>
```
  <my-hero prefix="You are my" [hero]="currentHero"></my-hero>
```

The `[hero]` binding, on the other hand, remains a live binding to the component's `currentHero` property.

### Property binding or interpolation?  {#property-binding-or-interpolation}

You often have a choice between interpolation and property binding.
The following binding pairs do the same thing:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (property-binding-vs-interpolation)"?>
```
  <p><img src="{!{heroImageUrl}!}"> is the <i>interpolated</i> image.</p>
  <p><img [src]="heroImageUrl"> is the <i>property bound</i> image.</p>

  <p><span>"{!{title}!}" is the <i>interpolated</i> title.</span></p>
  <p>"<span [innerHTML]="title"></span>" is the <i>property bound</i> title.</p>
```

_Interpolation_ is a convenient alternative to _property binding_ in many cases.

When rendering data values as strings, there is no technical reason to prefer one form to the other,
but interpolation can be more readable.
We suggest establishing coding style rules and choosing the form that
both conforms to the rules and feels most natural for the task at hand.

When setting an element property to a non-string data value, you must use _property binding_.

#### Content security

Imagine the following *malicious content*.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.dart (evil-title)"?>
```
  String evilTitle =
      'Template <script>alert("evil never sleeps")</script>Syntax';
```

Fortunately, Angular data binding is on alert for dangerous HTML.
It [*sanitizes*](security#sanitization-and-security-contexts) the values before displaying them.
It **does not** allow HTML with script tags to leak into the browser, neither with interpolation
nor property binding.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (property-binding-vs-interpolation-sanitization)"?>
```
  <!--
    Angular generates warnings for these two lines as it sanitizes them
    WARNING: sanitizing HTML stripped some content (see http://g.co/ng/security#xss).
   -->
  <p><span>"{!{evilTitle}!}" is the <i>interpolated</i> evil title.</span></p>
  <p>"<span [innerHTML]="evilTitle"></span>" is the <i>property bound</i> evil title.</p>
```

Interpolation handles the script tags differently than property binding but both approaches render the
content harmlessly.

## Attribute, class, and style bindings  {#other-bindings}

The template syntax provides specialized one-way bindings for scenarios less well suited to property binding.

### Attribute binding

You can set the value of an attribute directly with an **attribute binding**.

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  This is the only exception to the rule that a binding sets a target property.
  This is the only binding that creates and sets an attribute.
</div>

This guide stresses repeatedly that setting an element property with a property binding
is always preferred to setting the attribute with a string. Why does Angular offer attribute binding?

**You must use attribute binding when there is no element property to bind.**

Consider the [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA),
[SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG), and
table span attributes. They are pure attributes.
They do not correspond to element properties, and they do not set element properties.
There are no property targets to bind to.

This fact becomes painfully obvious when writing something like this:

```html
<tr><td colspan="{!{1 + 1}!}">Three-Four</td></tr>
```

The result is this error:

```
Template parse errors:
Can't bind to 'colspan' since it isn't a known native property
```

As the message says, the `<td>` element does not have a `colspan` property.
It has the "colspan" *attribute*, but
interpolation and property binding can set only *properties*, not attributes.

You need attribute bindings to create and bind to such attributes.

Attribute binding syntax resembles property binding.
Instead of an element property between brackets, start with the prefix **`attr`**,
followed by a dot (`.`) and the name of the attribute.
You then set the attribute value, using an expression that resolves to a string.

Bind `[attr.colspan]` to a calculated value:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (attrib-binding-colspan)"?>
```
  <table border="1">
    <!--  expression calculates colspan=2 -->
    <tr><td [attr.colspan]="1 + 1">One-Two</td></tr>

    <!-- ERROR: There is no `colspan` property to set!
      <tr><td colspan="{!{1 + 1}!}">Three-Four</td></tr>
    -->

    <tr><td>Five</td><td>Six</td></tr>
  </table>
```

Here's how the table renders:

<table border="1px">
  <tr><td colspan="2">One-Two</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Five</td><td>Six</td></tr>
 </table>

One of the primary use cases for attribute binding
is to set ARIA attributes, as in this example:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (attrib-binding-aria)"?>
```
  <!-- create and set an aria attribute for assistive technology -->
  <button [attr.aria-label]="actionName">{!{actionName}!} with Aria</button>
```

<a href="#page-content">back to top</a>
<div class="l-hr"></div>

### Class binding

You can add and remove CSS class names from an element's `class` attribute with
a **class binding**.

Class binding syntax resembles property binding.
Instead of an element property between brackets, start with the prefix `class`,
optionally followed by a dot (`.`) and the name of a CSS class: `[class.class-name]`.

The following examples show how to add and remove the app's "special" class
with class bindings.  Here's how to set the attribute without binding:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (class-binding-1)"?>
```
  <!-- standard class attribute setting  -->
  <div class="bad curly special">Bad curly special</div>
```

You can replace that with a binding to a string of the desired class names; this is an all-or-nothing, replacement binding.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (class-binding-2)"?>
```
  <!-- reset/override all class names with a binding  -->
  <div class="bad curly special"
       [class]="badCurly">Bad curly</div>
```

Finally, you can bind to a specific class name.
Angular adds the class when the template expression evaluates to true.
It removes the class when the expression is false.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (class-binding-3)"?>
```
  <!-- toggle the "special" class on/off with a property -->
  <div [class.special]="isSpecial">The class binding is special</div>

  <!-- binding to `class.special` trumps the class attribute -->
  <div class="special"
       [class.special]="!isSpecial">This one is not so special</div>
```

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  While this is a fine way to toggle a single class name,
  the [NgClass directive](#ngClass) is usually preferred when managing multiple class names at the same time.
</div>

<a href="#page-content">back to top</a>
<div class="l-hr"></div>

### Style binding

You can set inline styles with a **style binding**.

Style binding syntax resembles property binding.
Instead of an element property between brackets, start with the prefix `style`,
followed by a dot (`.`) and the name of a CSS style property: `[style.style-property]`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (style-binding-1)"?>
```
  <button [style.color]="isSpecial ? 'red': 'green'">Red</button>
  <button [style.background-color]="canSave ? 'cyan': 'grey'" >Save</button>
```

Some style binding styles have a unit extension.
The following example conditionally sets the font size in  “em” and “%” units .

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (style-binding-2)"?>
```
  <button [style.font-size.em]="isSpecial ? 3 : 1" >Big</button>
  <button [style.font-size.%]="!isSpecial ? 150 : 50" >Small</button>
```

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  While this is a fine way to set a single style,
  the [NgStyle directive](#ngStyle) is generally preferred when setting several inline styles at the same time.

  Note that a _style property_ name can be written in either
  [dash-case](/glossary#dash-case), as shown above, or
  [camelCase](/glossary#camelcase), such as `fontSize`.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  <h4>Style property names</h4>

  While [camelCase](/glossary#camelcase) and
  [dash-case](/glossary#dash-case) style property naming schemes are
  equivalent in AngularDart, only dash-case names are recognized by the
  `dart:html` [CssStyleDeclaration][CssSD] methods `getPropertyValue()`
  and `setProperty()`.
  So using dash-case for style property names is generally preferred.

  [CssSD]: {{site.dart_api}}/{{site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.channel}}/dart-html/CssStyleDeclaration-class.html

## Event binding  ( <span class="syntax">(event)</span> )  {#event-binding}

The bindings directives you've met so far flow data in one direction: **from a component to an element**.

Users don't just stare at the screen. They enter text into input boxes. They pick items from lists.
They click buttons. Such user actions can result in a flow of data in the opposite direction:
**from an element to a component**.

The only way to know about a user action is to listen for certain events such as
keystrokes, mouse movements, clicks, and touches.
You declare your interest in user actions through Angular event binding.

Event binding syntax consists of a **target event** name
within parentheses on the left of an equal sign, and a quoted
[template statement](#template-statements) on the right.
The following event binding listens for the button's click events, calling
the component's `onSave()` method whenever a click occurs:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (event-binding-1)"?>
```
  <button (click)="onSave()">Save</button>
```

### Target event

A **name between parentheses** &mdash; for example, `(click)` &mdash;
identifies the target event. In the following example, the target is the button's click event.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (event-binding-1)"?>
```
  <button (click)="onSave()">Save</button>
```

Some people prefer the `on-` prefix alternative, known as the **canonical form**:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (event-binding-2)"?>
```
  <button on-click="onSave()">On Save</button>
```

Element events might be the more common targets, but Angular looks first to see if the name matches an event property
of a known directive, as it does in the following example:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (event-binding-3)"?>
```
  <!-- `myClick` is an event on the custom `ClickDirective` -->
  <div (myClick)="clickMessage=$event" clickable>click with myClick</div>
```

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  The `myClick` directive is further described in the section
  on [aliasing input/output properties](#aliasing-io).
</div>

If the name fails to match an element event or an output property of a known directive,
Angular reports an “unknown directive” error.

### *$event* and event handling statements

In an event binding, Angular sets up an event handler for the target event.

When the event is raised, the handler executes the template statement.
The template statement typically involves a receiver, which performs an action
in response to the event, such as storing a value from the HTML control
into a model.

The binding conveys information about the event, including data values, through
an **event object named `$event`**.

The shape of the event object is determined by the target event.
If the target event is a native DOM element event, then `$event` is a
[DOM event object]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events),
with properties such as `target` and `target.value`.

Consider this example:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (without-NgModel)"?>
```
  <input [value]="currentHero.name"
         (input)="currentHero.name=$event.target.value" >
```

This code sets the input box `value` property by binding to the `name` property.
To listen for changes to the value, the code binds to the input box's `input` event.
When the user makes changes, the `input` event is raised, and the binding executes
the statement within a context that includes the DOM event object, `$event`.

To update the `name` property, the changed text is retrieved by following the path `$event.target.value`.

If the event belongs to a directive (recall that components are directives),
`$event` has whatever shape the directive decides to produce.

<div id="custom-event"></div>
### Custom events

Directives typically raise custom events using a [StreamController]({{site.dart_api}}/{{site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.channel}}/dart-async/StreamController-class.html).
The directive creates a `StreamController` and exposes its underlying `stream` as a property.
The directive calls `StreamController.add(payload)` to fire an event, passing in a message payload, which can be anything.
Parent directives listen for the event by binding to this property and accessing the payload through the `$event` object.

Consider a `HeroComponent` that presents hero information and responds to user actions.
Although the `HeroComponent` has a delete button it doesn't know how to delete the hero itself.
The best it can do is raise an event reporting the user's delete request.

Here are the pertinent excerpts from that `HeroComponent`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/hero_component.dart (template)" region="template-1" title?>
```
  template: '''
    <div>
      <img src="{!{heroImageUrl}!}">
      <span [style.text-decoration]="lineThrough">
        {!{prefix}!} {!{hero?.name}!}
      </span>
      <button (click)="delete()">Delete</button>
    </div>
  ''',
```
<?code-excerpt "lib/src/hero_component.dart (deleteRequest)" plaster="none" title?>
```
  final _deleteRequest = StreamController<Hero>();
  @Output()
  Stream<Hero> get deleteRequest => _deleteRequest.stream;

  void delete() {
    _deleteRequest.add(hero);
  }
```

The component defines a private `StreamController` property and
exposes the controller's stream through the `deleteRequest` getter.
When a user clicks *Delete*, the component's `delete()` method is called,
directing the `StreamController` to add a `Hero` to the stream.

Now imagine a hosting parent component that binds to the `HeroComponent`'s `deleteRequest` event.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (event-binding-to-component)"?>
```
  <my-hero (deleteRequest)="deleteHero($event)" [hero]="currentHero"></my-hero>
```

When the `deleteRequest` event fires, Angular calls the parent component's `deleteHero` method,
passing the *hero-to-delete* (emitted by `HeroDetail`) in the `$event` variable.

### Template statements have side effects

The `deleteHero` method has a side effect: it deletes a hero.
Template statement side effects are not just OK, but expected.

Deleting the hero updates the model, perhaps triggering other changes
including queries and saves to a remote server.
These changes percolate through the system and are ultimately displayed in this and other views.

### Event bubbling and propagation [TODO: reinstate this section when it becomes true]

Angular invokes the event-handling statement if the event is raised by the current element or one of its child elements.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (event-binding-bubbling)"?>
```
  <div class="parent-div" (click)="onClickMe($event)" clickable>Click me
    <div class="child-div">Click me too!</div>
  </div>
```

Many DOM events, both [native](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Overview_of_Events_and_Handlers ) and [custom](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events ), bubble up their ancestor tree of DOM elements until an event handler along the way prevents further propagation.

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
    `EventEmitter` events don't bubble.
</div>

The result of an event binding statement determines whether
[event propagation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Examples#Example_5:_Event_Propagation)
continues or stops with the current element.

Event propagation stops if the binding statement returns a false value (as does a method with no return value).
Clicking the button in the next example triggers a save;
the click doesn't make it to the outer `<div>` so the div's save handler is not called.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (event-binding-no-propagation)"?>
```
  <!-- Will save only once -->
  <div (click)="onSave()" clickable>
    <button (click)="onSave($event)">Save, no propagation</button>
  </div>
```

Propagation continues if the statement returns a true value. In the next example, the click is heard by both the button
and the outer `<div>`, causing a double save.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (event-binding-propagation)"?>
```
  <!-- Will save twice -->
  <div (click)="onSave()" clickable>
    <button (click)="onSave()">Save w/ propagation</button>
  </div>
```

## Two-way binding ( <span class="syntax">[(...)]</span> )  {#two-way}

You often want to both display a data property and update that property when the user makes changes.

On the element side that takes a combination of setting a specific element property
and listening for an element change event.

Angular offers a special _two-way data binding_ syntax for this purpose, **`[(x)]`**.
The `[(x)]` syntax combines the brackets
of _property binding_, `[x]`, with the parentheses of _event binding_, `(x)`.

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  <h4>[( )] = banana in a box</h4>

  Visualize a *banana in a box* to remember that the parentheses go _inside_ the brackets.
</div>

The `[(x)]` syntax is easy to demonstrate when the element has a settable property called `x`
and a corresponding event named `xChange`.
Here's a `SizerComponent` that fits the pattern.
It has a `size` value property and a companion `sizeChange` event:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/sizer_component.dart" title linenums?>
```
  import 'dart:async';
  import 'dart:math';
  import 'package:angular/angular.dart';

  const minSize = 8;
  const maxSize = minSize * 5;

  @Component(
    selector: 'my-sizer',
    template: '''
      <div>
        <button (click)="dec()" [disabled]="size <= minSize">-</button>
        <button (click)="inc()" [disabled]="size >= maxSize">+</button>
        <label [style.font-size.px]="size">FontSize: {!{size}!}px</label>
      </div>''',
    exports: [minSize, maxSize],
  )
  class SizerComponent {
    int _size = minSize * 2;
    int get size => _size;
    @Input()
    void set size(/*String|int*/ val) {
      int z = val is int ? val : int.tryParse(val);
      if (z != null) _size = min(maxSize, max(minSize, z));
    }

    final _sizeChange = StreamController<int>();
    @Output()
    Stream<int> get sizeChange => _sizeChange.stream;

    void dec() => resize(-1);
    void inc() => resize(1);

    void resize(int delta) {
      size = size + delta;
      _sizeChange.add(size);
    }
  }
```

The initial `size` is an input value from a property binding.
Clicking the buttons increases or decreases the `size`, within min/max values constraints,
and then raises (_emits_) the `sizeChange` event with the adjusted size.

Here's an example in which the `AppComponent.fontSizePx` is two-way bound to the `SizerComponent`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (two-way-1)"?>
```
  <my-sizer [(size)]="fontSizePx" #mySizer></my-sizer>
  <div [style.font-size.px]="mySizer.size">Resizable Text</div>
```

The `AppComponent.fontSizePx` establishes the initial `SizerComponent.size` value.
Clicking the buttons updates the `AppComponent.fontSizePx` via the two-way binding.
The revised `size` value flows through to the _style_ binding,
making the displayed text bigger or smaller.

The two-way binding syntax is really just syntactic sugar for a _property_ binding and an _event_ binding.
Angular _desugars_ the `SizerComponent` binding into this:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (two-way-2)"?>
```
  <my-sizer [size]="fontSizePx" (sizeChange)="fontSizePx=$event"></my-sizer>
```

The `$event` variable contains the payload of the `SizerComponent.sizeChange` event.
Angular assigns the `$event` value to the `AppComponent.fontSizePx` when the user clicks the buttons.

Clearly the two-way binding syntax is a great convenience compared to separate property and event bindings.

It would be convenient to use two-way binding with HTML form elements like `<input>` and `<select>`.
However, no native HTML element follows the `x` value and `xChange` event pattern.

Fortunately, the Angular [_NgModel_](#ngModel) directive is a bridge that enables two-way binding to form elements.

<div class="l-hr"></div>

## Built-in directives  {#directives}

Earlier versions of Angular included over seventy built-in directives.
The community contributed many more, and countless private directives
have been created for internal apps.

You don't need many of those directives in Angular.
You can often achieve the same results with the more capable and expressive Angular binding system.
Why create a directive to handle a click when you can write a simple binding such as this?

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (event-binding-1)"?>
```
  <button (click)="onSave()">Save</button>
```

You still benefit from directives that simplify complex tasks.
Angular still ships with built-in directives; just not as many.
You'll write your own directives, just not as many.

This segment reviews some of the most frequently used built-in directives,
classified as either [_attribute_ directives](#attribute-directives) or [_structural_ directives](#structural-directives).

<a href="#page-content">back to top</a>
<div class="l-hr"></div>

## Built-in _attribute_ directives  {#attribute-directives}

Attribute directives listen to and modify the behavior of
other HTML elements, attributes, properties, and components.
They are usually applied to elements as if they were HTML attributes, hence the name.

Many details are covered in the [_Attribute Directives_](attribute-directives) guide.
Many Angular packages such as the [`Router`](router "Routing and Navigation")
and [`Forms`](forms) packages define their own attribute directives.
This section is an introduction to the most commonly used attribute directives:

* [`NgClass`](#ngClass): Add and remove a set of CSS classes.
* [`NgStyle`](#ngStyle): Add and remove a set of HTML styles.
* [`NgModel`](#ngModel): Two-way data binding to an HTML form element.

<div class="l-hr"></div>

<div id="ngClass"></div>
### NgClass

You typically control how elements appear
by adding and removing CSS classes dynamically.
You can bind to the `ngClass` to add or remove several classes simultaneously.

A [class binding](#class-binding) is a good way to add or remove a *single* class.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (class-binding-3a)"?>
```
  <!-- toggle the "special" class on/off with a property -->
  <div [class.special]="isSpecial">The class binding is special</div>
```

To add or remove *many* CSS classes at the same time, the `NgClass` directive might be the better choice.

Try binding `ngClass` to a key:value control [Map][].
Each key of the object is a CSS class name; its value is `true` if the class should be added,
`false` if it should be removed.

Consider a `setCurrentClasses` component method that sets a component property,
`currentClasses` with an object that adds or removes three classes based on the
`true`/`false` state of three other component properties:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.dart (setClasses)"?>
```
  Map<String, bool> currentClasses = <String, bool>{};
  void setCurrentClasses() {
    currentClasses = <String, bool>{
      'saveable': canSave,
      'modified': !isUnchanged,
      'special': isSpecial
    };
  }
```

Adding an `ngClass` property binding to `currentClasses` sets the element's classes accordingly:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgClass-1)"?>
```
  <div [ngClass]="currentClasses">This div is initially saveable, unchanged, and special</div>
```

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  It's up to you to call `setCurrentClasses()`, both initially and when the dependent properties change.
</div>

<a href="#page-content">back to top</a>
<div class="l-hr"></div>

<div id="ngStyle"></div>
### NgStyle

You can set inline styles dynamically, based on the state of the component.
With `NgStyle` you can set many inline styles simultaneously.

A [style binding](#style-binding) is an easy way to set a *single* style value.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgStyle-1)"?>
```
  <div [style.font-size]="isSpecial ? 'x-large' : 'smaller'" >
    This div is x-large or smaller.
  </div>
```

To set *many* inline styles at the same time, the `NgStyle` directive might be the better choice.

Try binding `ngStyle` to a key:value control [Map][].
Each key of the object is a style name; its value is whatever is appropriate for that style.

Consider a `setCurrentStyles` component method that sets a component property, `currentStyles`
with an object that defines three styles, based on the state of three other component propertes:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.dart (setStyles)"?>
```
  Map<String, String> currentStyles = <String, String>{};
  void setCurrentStyles() {
    currentStyles = <String, String>{
      'font-style': canSave ? 'italic' : 'normal',
      'font-weight': !isUnchanged ? 'bold' : 'normal',
      'font-size': isSpecial ? '24px' : '12px'
    };
  }
```

Adding an `ngStyle` property binding to `currentStyles` sets the element's styles accordingly:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgStyle-2)"?>
```
  <div [ngStyle]="currentStyles">
    This div is initially italic, normal weight, and extra large (24px).
  </div>
```

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  It's up to you to call `setCurrentStyles()`, both initially and when the dependent properties change.
</div>

<a href="#page-content">back to top</a>
<div class="l-hr"></div>

<div id="ngModel"></div>
### NgModel - Two-way binding to form elements with <span class="syntax">[(ngModel)]</span>

When developing data entry forms, you often both display a data property and
update that property when the user makes changes.

Two-way data binding with the `NgModel` directive makes that easy. Here's an example:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgModel-1)"?>
```
  <input [(ngModel)]="currentHero.name">
```

#### Inside <span class="syntax">[(ngModel)]</span>

Looking back at the `name` binding, note that
you could achieve the same result with separate bindings to
the `<input>` element's  `value` property and `input` event.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (without-NgModel)"?>
```
  <input [value]="currentHero.name"
         (input)="currentHero.name=$event.target.value" >
```

That's cumbersome. Who can remember which element property to set and which element event emits user changes?
How do you extract the currently displayed text from the input box so you can update the data property?
Who wants to look that up each time?

That `ngModel` directive hides these onerous details behind its own  `ngModel` input and `ngModelChange` output properties.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgModel-3)"?>
```
  <input
    [ngModel]="currentHero.name"
    (ngModelChange)="currentHero.name=$event">
```

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  The `ngModel` data property sets the element's value property and the `ngModelChange` event property
  listens for changes to the element's value.

  The details are specific to each kind of element and therefore the `NgModel` directive only works for an element
  supported by a [ControlValueAccessor]({{site.pub-api}}/angular_forms/{{site.data.pkg-vers.angular.vers}}/angular_forms/ControlValueAccessor-class.html)
  that adapts an element to this protocol.
  The `<input>` box is one of those elements.
  Angular provides *value accessors* for all of the basic HTML form elements and the
  [_Forms_](forms) guide shows how to bind to them.

  You can't apply `[(ngModel)]` to a non-form native element or a third-party custom component
  until you write a suitable *value accessor*,
  a technique that is beyond the scope of this guide.

  You don't need a _value accessor_ for an Angular component that you write because you
  can name the value and event properties
  to suit Angular's basic [two-way binding syntax](#two-way) and skip `NgModel` altogether.
  The [`sizer` shown above](#two-way) is an example of this technique.
</div>

Separate `ngModel` bindings is an improvement over binding to the element's native properties. You can do better.

You shouldn't have to mention the data property twice. Angular should be able to capture
the component's data property and set it
with a single declaration, which it can with the `[(ngModel)]` syntax:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgModel-1)"?>
```
  <input [(ngModel)]="currentHero.name">
```

Is `[(ngModel)]` all you need? Is there ever a reason to fall back to its expanded form?

The `[(ngModel)]` syntax can only _set_ a data-bound property.
If you need to do something more or something different, you can write the expanded form.

The following contrived example forces the input value to uppercase:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgModel-4)"?>
```
  <input
    [ngModel]="currentHero.name"
    (ngModelChange)="setUppercaseName($event)">
```

Here are all variations in action, including the uppercase version:

## Built-in _structural_ directives

Structural directives are responsible for HTML layout.
They shape or reshape the DOM's _structure_, typically by adding, removing, and manipulating
the host elements to which they are attached.

The deep details of structural directives are covered in the
[_Structural Directives_](structural-directives) guide,
where you'll learn the following:

* Why you must
[_prefix the directive name with an asterisk_ (\*)](structural-directives#asterisk "The * in *ngIf").
* How to [group elements](structural-directives#group-sibling-elements)
when there is no suitable host element for the directive.
* How to write your own structural directive.
* Why you can apply only [one structural directive](structural-directives#one-per-element "one per host element") to an element.

_This_ section is an introduction to the common structural directives:

* [`NgIf`](#ngIf): Conditionally add or remove an element from the DOM.
* [`NgFor`](#ngFor): Repeat a template for each item in a list.
* [`NgSwitch`](#ngSwitch): Show only one of multiple possible elements.

<div class="l-hr"></div>
<div id="ngIf"></div>
### NgIf

You can add or remove an element from the DOM by applying an `NgIf` directive to
that element (called the _host elment_).
Bind the directive to a condition expression like `isActive` in this example.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgIf-1)"?>
```
  <my-hero *ngIf="isActive"></my-hero>
```

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  Don't forget the asterisk (`*`) in front of `ngIf`.
</div>

When the `isActive` expression returns a true value, `NgIf` adds the `HeroComponent` to the DOM.
When the expression is false, `NgIf` removes the `HeroComponent`
from the DOM, destroying that component and all of its sub-components.

#### Show/hide is not the same thing

You can control the visibility of an element with a
[class](#class-binding) or [style](#style-binding) binding:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgIf-3)"?>
```
  <!-- isSpecial is true -->
  <div [class.hidden]="!isSpecial">Show with class</div>
  <div [class.hidden]="isSpecial">Hide with class</div>

  <!-- HeroDetail is in the DOM but hidden -->
  <my-hero [class.hidden]="isSpecial"></my-hero>

  <div [style.display]="isSpecial ? 'block' : 'none'">Show with style</div>
  <div [style.display]="isSpecial ? 'none'  : 'block'">Hide with style</div>
```

Hiding an element is quite different from removing an element with `NgIf`.

When you hide an element, that element and all of its descendents remain in the DOM.
All components for those elements stay in memory, and
Angular might continue to check for changes.
Your app might hold onto considerable computing resources, degrading performance
for something the user can't see.

When `NgIf` is `false`, Angular removes the element and its descendents from the DOM.
It destroys their components, potentially freeing up substantial resources,
resulting in a more responsive user experience.

The show/hide technique is fine for a few elements with few children.
Be wary of hiding large component trees; `NgIf` might be the safer choice.

#### Guard against null

The `ngIf` directive is often used to guard against null.
Show/hide is useless as a guard.
Angular will throw an error if a nested expression tries to access a property of `null`.

Here we see `NgIf` guarding two `<div>`s.
The `currentHero` name appears only when there is a `currentHero`.
The `nullHero` is never displayed.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgIf-2)"?>
```
  <div *ngIf="currentHero != null">Hello, {!{currentHero.name}!}</div>
  <div *ngIf="nullHero != null">Hello, {!{nullHero.name}!}</div>
```

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  See also the
  [_safe navigation operator_](#safe-navigation-operator "Safe naviation operator (?.)")
  described below.
</div>

<a href="#page-content">back to top</a>
<div class="l-hr"></div>

<div id="ngFor"></div>
### NgFor

`NgFor` is a _repeater_ directive &mdash; a way to present a list of items.
You define a block of HTML that defines how a single item should be displayed.
You tell Angular to use that block as a template for rendering each item in the list.

Here is an example of `NgFor` applied to a simple `<div>`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgFor-1)"?>
```
  <div *ngFor="let hero of heroes">{!{hero.name}!}</div>
```

You can also apply an `NgFor` to a component element, as in this example:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgFor-2)"?>
```
  <my-hero *ngFor="let hero of heroes" [hero]="hero"></my-hero>
```

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  Don't forget the asterisk (`*`) in front of `ngFor`.
</div>

The text assigned to `*ngFor` is the instruction that guides the repeater process.

<div id="microsyntax"></div>
#### *ngFor microsyntax

The string assigned to `*ngFor` is not a [template expression](#template-expressions).
It's a *microsyntax* &mdash; a little language of its own that Angular interprets.
The string `"let hero of heroes"` means:

> *Take each hero in the `heroes` list, store it in the local `hero` looping variable, and
make it available to the templated HTML for each iteration.*

Angular translates this instruction into a `<template>` around the host element,
then uses this template repeatedly to create a new set of elements and bindings for each `hero`
in the list.

Learn about the _microsyntax_ in the [_Structural Directives_](structural-directives#microsyntax) guide.

<div id="template-input-variable"></div>
<div id="template-input-variables"></div>
### Template input variables

The `let` keyword before `hero` creates a _template input variable_ called `hero`.
The `ngFor` directive iterates over the `heroes` list returned by the parent component's `heroes` property
and sets `hero` to the current item from the list during each iteration.

To access the hero's properties,
reference the `hero` input variable within the `ngFor` host element
(or within its descendents).
Here `hero` is referenced first in an interpolation
and then passed in a binding to the `hero` property of the `<my-hero>` component.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgFor-1-2)" plaster="none"?>
```
  <div *ngFor="let hero of heroes">{!{hero.name}!}</div>
  <my-hero *ngFor="let hero of heroes" [hero]="hero"></my-hero>
```

Learn more about _template input variables_ in the
[_Structural Directives_](structural-directives#template-input-variable) guide.

#### *ngFor with _index_

The `index` property of the `NgFor` directive context  returns the zero-based index of the item in each iteration.
You can capture the `index` in a template input variable and use it in the template.

The next example captures the `index` in a variable named `i` and displays it with the hero name like this.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgFor-3)"?>
```
  <div *ngFor="let hero of heroes; let i=index">{!{i + 1}!} - {!{hero.name}!}</div>
```

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  Learn about the other `NgFor` context values such as `last`, `even`,
  and `odd` in the [NgFor API reference]({{site.pub-api}}/angular/{{site.data.pkg-vers.angular.vers}}/angular/NgFor-class.html).
</div>

#### *ngFor with _trackBy_ {#trackBy}

The `NgFor` directive can perform poorly, especially with large lists.
A small change to one item, an item removed, or an item added can trigger a cascade of DOM manipulations.

For example, re-querying the server might reset the list with all new hero objects.

Most, if not all, are previously displayed heroes.
*You* know this because the `id` of each hero hasn't changed.
But Angular sees only a fresh list of new object references.
It has no choice but to tear down the old DOM elements and insert all new DOM elements.

Angular can avoid this churn with `trackBy`.
Add a method to the component that returns the value `NgFor` _should_ track.
In this case, that value is the hero's `id`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.dart (trackByHeroId)"?>
```
  Object trackByHeroId(_, dynamic o) => o is Hero ? o.id : o;
```

In the microsyntax expression, set `trackBy` to this method.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (trackBy)" replace="/\s+#withTrackBy//g"?>
```
  <div *ngFor="let hero of heroes; trackBy: trackByHeroId">
    ({!{hero.id}!}) {!{hero.name}!}
  </div>
```

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  **Note:** A track-by function's signature must match the [TrackByFn][] type.
</aside>

Here is an illustration of the _trackBy_ effect.
"Reset heroes" creates new heroes with the same `hero.id`s.
"Change ids" creates new heroes with new `hero.id`s.
* With no `trackBy`, both buttons trigger complete DOM element replacement.
* With `trackBy`, only changing the `id` triggers element replacement.

<img class="image-display" src="{% asset ng/devguide/template-syntax/ng-for-track-by-anim.gif @path %}" alt="trackBy">

<a href="#page-content">back to top</a>
<div class="l-hr"></div>

<div id="ngSwitch"></div>
### The _NgSwitch_ directives

*NgSwitch* is like the Dart `switch` statement.
It can display _one_ element from among several possible elements, based on a _switch condition_.
Angular puts only the *selected* element into the DOM.

*NgSwitch* is actually a set of three, cooperating directives:
`NgSwitch`, `NgSwitchCase`, and `NgSwitchDefault` as seen in this example.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgSwitch)" plaster="none"?>
```
  <div [ngSwitch]="currentHero.emotion">
    <happy-hero    *ngSwitchCase="'happy'"    [hero]="currentHero"></happy-hero>
    <sad-hero      *ngSwitchCase="'sad'"      [hero]="currentHero"></sad-hero>
    <confused-hero *ngSwitchCase="'confused'" [hero]="currentHero"></confused-hero>
    <unknown-hero  *ngSwitchDefault           [hero]="currentHero"></unknown-hero>
  </div>
```

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  You might come across an `NgSwitchWhen` directive in older code.
  That is the deprecated name for `NgSwitchCase`.
</div>

<img class="image-display" src="{% asset ng/devguide/template-syntax/switch-anim.gif @path %}" alt="trackBy">

`NgSwitch` is the controller directive. Bind it to an expression that returns the *switch value*.
The `emotion` value in this example is a string, but the switch value can be of any type.

**Bind to `[ngSwitch]`**. You'll get an error if you try to set `*ngSwitch` because
`NgSwitch` is an *attribute* directive, not a *structural* directive.
It changes the behavior of its companion directives.
It doesn't touch the DOM directly.

**Bind to `*ngSwitchCase` and `*ngSwitchDefault`**.
The `NgSwitchCase` and `NgSwitchDefault` directives are _structural_ directives
because they add or remove elements from the DOM.

* `NgSwitchCase` adds its element to the DOM when its bound value equals the switch value.
* `NgSwitchDefault` adds its element to the DOM when there is no selected `NgSwitchCase`.

The switch directives are particularly useful for adding and removing *component elements*.
This example switches among four "emotional hero" components defined in the `hero_switch_components.dart` file.
Each component has a `hero` [input property](#inputs-outputs "Input property")
which is bound to the `currentHero` of the parent component.

Switch directives work as well with native elements and web components too.
For example, you can replace the `<confused-hero>` switch case with the following.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (NgSwitch-div)"?>
```
  <div *ngSwitchCase="'confused'">Are you as confused as {!{currentHero.name}!}?</div>
```

<div class="l-hr"></div>

## Template reference variables ( <span class="syntax">#var</span> )  {#ref-vars}

A **template reference variable** is often a reference to a DOM element within a template.
It can also refer to an Angular component or directive or a
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="MDN: Web Components">web component</a>.

Use the hash symbol (#) to declare a reference variable.
The `#phone` declares a `phone` variable on an `<input>` element.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (ref-var)"?>
```
  <input #phone placeholder="phone number">
```

You can refer to a template reference variable almost anywhere in the template
(see [notes below](#template-reference-notes) for exceptions).
The `phone` variable declared on this `<input>` is consumed in a `<button>` on
the other side of the template

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (ref-phone)"?>
```
  <input #phone placeholder="phone number">

  <!-- lots of other elements -->

  <!-- phone refers to the input element; pass its `value` to an event handler -->
  <button (click)="callPhone(phone.value)">Call</button>
```

### How a reference variable gets its value

In most cases, Angular sets the reference variable's value to the element on which it was declared.
In the previous example, `phone` refers to the _phone number_ `<input>` box.
The phone button click handler passes the _input_ value to the component's `callPhone` method.
But a directive can change that behavior and set the value to something else, such as itself.
The `NgForm` directive does that.

The following is a *simplified* version of the form example in the [Forms](forms) guide.

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/hero_form_component.html"?>
```
  <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(heroForm)" #heroForm="ngForm">
      <div class="form-group">
          <label for="name">Name
              <input class="form-control"
                     ngControl="name"
                     required
                     [(ngModel)]="hero.name">
          </label>
      </div>
      <button type="submit" [disabled]="!heroForm.form.valid">Submit</button>
  </form>
  <div [hidden]="!heroForm.form.valid">
      {!{submitMessage}!}
  </div>
```

A template reference variable, `heroForm`, appears three times in this example, separated
by a large amount of HTML.
What is the value of `heroForm`?
The `heroForm` is a reference to an Angular
[NgForm]({{site.pub-api}}/angular_forms/{{site.data.pkg-vers.angular.vers}}/angular_forms/NgForm-class.html "API: NgForm")
directive with the ability to track the value and validity of every control in the form.

The native `<form>` element doesn't have a `form` property.
But the `NgForm` directive does, which explains how you can disable the submit button
if the `heroForm.form.valid` is invalid and pass the entire form control tree
to the parent component's `onSubmit` method.

### Template reference variable warning notes {#template-reference-notes}

A template _reference_ variable (`#phone`) is _not_ the same as a template _input_ variable (`let phone`)
such as you might see in an [`*ngFor`](#template-input-variable).
Learn the difference in the [_Structural Directives_](structural-directives#template-input-variable) guide.

The scope of a reference variable is the _entire template_, unless it's declared
within an embedded view controlled by a [structural
directive](#built-in-structural-directives). Reference variables declared within
an embedded view are only visible to the portion of the template embedded by the
structural directive. Note that a reference variable declared outside an
embedded view can be referenced from within it, but not the other way around.

Do not define the same variable name more than once in the same template. The
runtime value will be unpredictable.

<div class="l-hr"></div>

## Input and output properties ( <span class="syntax">@Input</span> and <span class="syntax">@Output</span> )  {#inputs-outputs}

So far, this page has focused mainly on binding to component members within template expressions and statements
that appear on the *right side of the binding declaration*.
A member in that position is a data binding **source**.

This section concentrates on binding to **targets**, which are directive
properties on the *left side of the binding declaration*.
These directive properties must be declared as **inputs** or **outputs**.

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  Remember: All **components** are **directives**.
</div>

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  Note the important distinction between a data binding **target** and a data binding **source**.

  The *target* of a binding is to the *left* of the `=`.
  The *source* is on the *right* of the `=`.

  The *target* of a binding is the property or event inside the binding punctuation: `[]`, `()` or `[()]`.
  The *source* is either inside quotes (`" "`) or within an interpolation (`{!{}!}`).

  Every member of a **source** directive is automatically available for binding.
  You don't have to do anything special to access a directive member in a template expression or statement.

  You have *limited* access to members of a **target** directive.
  You can only bind to properties that are explicitly identified as *inputs* and *outputs*.
</div>

In the following snippet, `iconUrl` and `onSave` are data-bound members of the `AppComponent`
and are referenced within quoted syntax to the _right_ of the equals&nbsp;(`=`).

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (io-1)"?>
```
  <img [src]="iconUrl"/>
  <button (click)="onSave()">Save</button>
```

They are *neither inputs nor outputs* of the component. They are **sources** for their bindings.
The targets are the native `<img>` and `<button>` elements.

Now look at a another snippet in which the `HeroComponent`
is the **target** of a binding on the _left_ of the equals&nbsp;(`=`).

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (io-2)"?>
```
  <my-hero [hero]="currentHero" (deleteRequest)="deleteHero($event)">
  </my-hero>
```

Both `HeroComponent.hero` and `HeroComponent.deleteRequest` are on the **left side** of binding declarations.
`HeroComponent.hero` is inside brackets; it is the target of a property binding.
`HeroComponent.deleteRequest` is inside parentheses; it is the target of an event binding.

### Declaring input and output properties

Target properties must be explicitly marked as inputs or outputs.

In the `HeroComponent`, such properties are marked as input or output properties using annotations.

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/hero_component.dart (input-output-1)"?>
```
  @Input()
  Hero hero;
  final _deleteRequest = StreamController<Hero>();
  @Output()
  Stream<Hero> get deleteRequest => _deleteRequest.stream;
```

### Input or output?

*Input* properties usually receive data values.
*Output* properties expose event producers, such as
[Stream]({{site.dart_api}}/{{site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.channel}}/dart-async/Stream-class.html) objects.

The terms _input_ and _output_ reflect the perspective of the target directive.

<img class="image-display" src="{% asset ng/devguide/template-syntax/input-output.png @path %}" alt="Inputs and outputs">

`HeroComponent.hero` is an **input** property from the perspective of `HeroComponent`
because data flows *into* that property from a template binding expression.

`HeroComponent.deleteRequest` is an **output** property from the perspective of `HeroComponent`
because events stream *out* of that property and toward the handler in a template binding statement.

### Aliasing input/output properties  {#aliasing-io}

Sometimes the public name of an input/output property should be different from the internal name.

This is frequently the case with [attribute directives](attribute-directives).
Directive consumers expect to bind to the name of the directive.
For example, when you apply a directive with a `myClick` selector to a `<div>` tag,
you expect to bind to an event property that is also called `myClick`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (myClick)"?>
```
  <div (myClick)="clickMessage=$event" clickable>click with myClick</div>
```

However, the directive name is often a poor choice for the name of a property within the directive class.
The directive name rarely describes what the property does.
The `myClick` directive name is not a good name for a property that emits click messages.

Fortunately, you can create a public name for the property that meets conventional expectations,
while using a different name internally.
In the example immediately above, the code binds *through the* `myClick` *alias* to
the directive's own `clicks` property.

To specify the alias for the property name, pass the alias into the input/output decorator like this:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/click_directive.dart (output-myClick)"?>
```
  final _onClick = StreamController<String>();
  // @Output(alias) propertyName = ...
  @Output('myClick')
  Stream<String> get clicks => _onClick.stream;
```

<div class="l-hr"></div>

<div id="expression-operators"></div>
## Template expression operators

The template expression language employs a subset of Dart syntax supplemented with a few special operators
for specific scenarios. The next sections cover two of these operators: _pipe_ and _safe navigation operator_.

<div id="pipe"></div>
### The pipe operator ( <span class="syntax">|</span> )

The result of an expression might require some transformation before it's ready to use in a binding.
For example, you might display a number as a currency, force text to uppercase, or filter a list and sort it.

Angular [pipes](pipes) are a good choice for small transformations such as these.
Pipes are simple functions that accept an input value and return a transformed value.
They're easy to apply within template expressions, using the **pipe operator (`|`)**:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (pipes-1)"?>
```
  <div>Title through uppercase pipe: {!{title | uppercase}!}</div>
```

The pipe operator passes the result of an expression on the left to a pipe function on the right.

You can chain expressions through multiple pipes:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (pipes-2)"?>
```
  <!-- Pipe chaining: convert title to uppercase, then to lowercase -->
  <div>
    Title through a pipe chain:
    {!{title | uppercase | lowercase}!}
  </div>
```

You can also [apply parameters](pipes#parameterizing-a-pipe) to a pipe:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (pipes-3)"?>
```
  <!-- pipe with configuration argument => "February 25, 1970" -->
  <div>Birthdate: {!{currentHero?.birthdate | date:'longDate'}!}</div>
```

The `json` pipe can be helpful for debugging bindings:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (pipes-json)"?>
```
  <div>{!{currentHero | json}!}</div>
```

The generated output looks something like this:

```json
{ "id": 0, "name": "Hercules", "emotion": "happy",
  "birthdate": "1970-02-25T08:00:00.000Z",
  "url": "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065832/",
  "rate": 325 }
```

<a href="#page-content">back to top</a>
<div class="l-hr"></div>

<div id="safe-navigation-operator"></div>
### The safe navigation operator ( <span class="syntax">?.</span> ) and null property paths

The Angular **safe navigation operator (`?.`)**, like the Dart [conditional member
access]({{site.dartlang}}/guides/language/language-tour#other-operators)
operator, is a fluent and convenient way to
guard against null values in property paths.
Here it is, protecting against a view render failure if the `currentHero` is null.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (safe-2)"?>
```
  The current hero's name is {!{currentHero?.name}!}
```

What happens when the following data bound `title` property is null?

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (safe-1)"?>
```
  The title is {!{title}!}
```

The view still renders but the displayed value is blank; you see only "The title is" with nothing after it.
That is reasonable behavior. At least the app doesn't crash.

Suppose the template expression involves a property path, as in this next example
that displays the `name` of a null hero.

```html
The null hero's name is {!{nullHero.name}}
```

Dart throws an exception, and so does Angular:

```nocode
EXCEPTION: The null object does not have a getter 'name'.
```

Worse, the *entire view disappears*.

This would be reasonable behavior if the `hero` property could never be null.
If it must never be null and yet it is null,
that's a programming error that should be caught and fixed.
Throwing an exception is the right thing to do.

On the other hand, null values in the property path might be OK from time to time,
especially when the data are null now and will arrive eventually.

While waiting for data, the view should render without complaint, and
the null property path should display as blank just as the `title` property does.

Unfortunately, the app crashes when the `currentHero` is null.

You could code around that problem with [*ngIf](#ngIf).

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (safe-4)"?>
```
  <!--No hero, div not displayed, no error -->
  <div *ngIf="nullHero != null">The null hero's name is {!{nullHero.name}!}</div>
```

These approaches have merit but can be cumbersome, especially if the property path is long.
Imagine guarding against a null somewhere in a long property path such as `a.b.c.d`.

The Angular safe navigation operator (`?.`) is a more fluent and convenient way to guard against nulls in property paths.
The expression bails out when it hits the first null value.
The display is blank, but the app keeps rolling without errors.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (safe-6)"?>
```
  <!-- No hero, no problem! -->
  The null hero's name is {!{nullHero?.name}!}
```

It works perfectly with long property paths such as `a?.b?.c?.d`.

You've completed this survey of template syntax.
