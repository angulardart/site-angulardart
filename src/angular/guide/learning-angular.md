You don't have to read the documentation straight through,
but here's a possible learning path if you're new to Angular:

1. Follow [Get Started](/guides/get-started),
   which leads you through creating, running, and modifying an AngularDart app.

1. Take the [*Tour of Heroes* tutorial](../tutorial "Tour of Heroes").

   The *Tour of Heroes* takes you step-by-step from setup
   to a full-featured example that demonstrates the essential characteristics of a professional application:
   a sensible project structure, data binding, master/detail, services, dependency injection, navigation, and remote data access.

1. <a id="architecture"></a>Read the [Architecture](architecture) overview for the big picture.

1. Read [Displaying Data](displaying-data) to see how data binding puts
   component property values on screen.

1. Read [User Input](user-input) to learn how to respond to user-initiated DOM events.

1. Read [Forms](forms.html), which covers data entry and validation within the UI.

1. Read [Dependency Injection](dependency-injection) to learn how to build large,
   maintainable applications from small, single-purpose parts.

1. Scan [Template Syntax](template-syntax.html),
   a comprehensive study of Angular template HTML.

Then feel free to skip around among the other pages on this site.

### Next step

Try the [tutorial](../tutorial "Tour of Heroes") if you're ready to start coding, or
visit the [architecture overview](architecture.html "Basic Concepts") if you prefer to learn the basic concepts first.
