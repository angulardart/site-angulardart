{% include_relative _milestone-nav.md selectedOption="5" %}

At the moment, *any* user can navigate *anywhere* in the app *anytime*.
That's not always the right thing to do.

* Perhaps the user is not authorized to navigate to the target component.
* Maybe the user must login (*authenticate*) first.
* Maybe you should fetch some data before you display the target component.
* You might want to save pending changes before leaving a component.
* You might ask the user if it's OK to discard pending changes rather than save them.

You can provide _router lifecycle hooks_ to handle these scenarios.

A router lifecycle hook is a boolean function. The returned boolean value
affects the router's navigation behavior either canceling navigation
(and staying on the current view) or allowing navigation to proceed.

Lifecycle hooks can also tell the router to navigate to a *different* component.

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  The router lifecycle hooks _supplement_, and are distinct from,
  [component lifecycle hooks](../lifecycle-hooks).
</div>

You're already familiar with the [OnActivate][] hook that was [introduced in an
earlier milestone](3#on-activate). You'll learn about other hooks below.

{% comment %} TODO: summarize hooks{% endcomment %}

## Handling unsaved crisis name changes

The app currently accepts every change to a hero name immediately without delay
or validation. More often, you'd accumulate a user's changes so that the app
can, for example:

- Validate across fields
- Validate on the server
- Hold changes in a pending state until the user confirms them *as a group* or
  cancels and reverts all changes

What should be done with unsaved changes when the user navigates away? Just
ignoring changes offers a bad user experience.

Let the user decide what to do.
If the user cancels navigation, then the app can stay put and allow more changes.
If the user approves, then the app can save.

The app might still delay navigation until the save succeeds.
If you let the user move to the next screen immediately and
the save failed, you would have lost the context of the error.

The app can't block while waiting for the server &mdash; that's not possible in a browser.
The app needs to stop the navigation while waiting, asynchronously, for the server
to return with its answer.

For this, you need the [CanNavigate][] hook.

### Add _Save_ and _Cancel_ buttons

The sample app doesn't talk to a server.
Fortunately, you have another way to demonstrate an asynchronous router hook.

Before defining a hook, you'll need to make the following edits to the crisis component
so that user changes to the crisis name are temporary until saved
(in contrast, `HeroComponent` name changes will remain immediate).

Update `CrisisComponent`:

- Add a string `name` field to hold the crisis name while it is being edited.

<ul><li markdown="1">
Initialize `name` in the `onActivate()` hook.

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis/crisis_component.dart (onActivate)" remove="/·|log/" replace="/name = .*?name;/[!$&!]/g" title?>
```
  void onActivate(_, RouterState current) async {
    final id = getId(current.parameters);
    if (id == null) return null;
    crisis = await (_crisisService.get(id));
    [!name = crisis?.name;!]
  }
```
</li><li markdown="1">
Add a `save()` method which assigns `name` to the selected crisis before navigating back
to the crisis list.

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis/crisis_component.dart (save)" remove="log" title?>
```
  Future<void> save() async {
    crisis?.name = name;
    goBack();
  }
```
</li></ul>

Update the crisis component template by doing the following:

- Renaming the _Back_ button to _Cancel_.
- Adding a _Save_ button with a click event binding to the `save()` method.
- Changing the `ngModel` expression from `crisis.name` to `name`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis/crisis_component.html (save and cancel)" title?>
```
  <div>
    <label>name: </label>
    <input [(ngModel)]="name" placeholder="name" />
  </div>
  <button (click)="goBack()">Cancel</button>
  <button (click)="save()">Save</button>
```

<i class="material-icons">open_in_browser</i>
**Refresh the browser** and try out the new crisis details save and cancel features.

<a id="can-navigate"></a>
## *CanNavigate* hook to handle unsaved changes

What if the user tries to navigate away without saving or canceling?
The user could push the browser back button or click the heroes link.
Both actions trigger a navigation.
Should the app save or cancel automatically?

It currently does neither. Instead you'll ask the user to make that choice
explicitly in a confirmation dialog. To implement this functionality you'll need
a dialog service; the following simple implementation will do.

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis/dialog_service.dart" title?>
```
  import 'dart:async';
  import 'dart:html';

  class DialogService {
    Future<bool> confirm(String message) async =>
        window.confirm(message ?? 'Ok?');
  }
```

Add `DialogService` to the `CrisisListComponent` providers list so that the service
is available to all components in the crises component subtree:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis/crisis_list_component.dart (providers)" replace="/\S+DialogService.*/[!$&!]/g" title?>
```
  providers: [
    ClassProvider(CrisisService),
    [!ClassProvider(DialogService),!]
  ],
```

Next, implement a router [CanNavigate][] lifecycle hook in `CrisisComponent`:

- Add the router `CanNavigate` interface to the class's list of implemented interfaces.
- Add a private field and constructor argument to hold an injected
  instance of a `DialogService` &mdash; remember to import it.
- Add the following `canNavigate()` lifecycle hook:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis/crisis_component.dart (canNavigate)" remove="/\blog\b/" title?>
```
  Future<bool> canNavigate() async {
    return crisis?.name == name ||
        await _dialogService.confirm('Discard changes?');
  }
```

Since the router calls the `canNavigate()` method when necessary, so you don't
need to worry about the different ways that the user can navigate away.

## _CanDeactivate_ hook

If you can decide whether it's ok to navigate _away_ from a component solely
based on the component's state, then use `CanNavigate`. Sometimes you need to
know the next router state: for example, if the current and next route haven't
changed, but navigation was triggered for another reason such as an added query
parameter. In such cases, use the [CanDeactivate][] hook to selectively prevent
deactivation.

The crisis component doesn't need a `canDeactivate()` lifecycle method, but if
it had one, the method signature would be like this:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis/crisis_component.dart (canDeactivate)" remove="log(" replace="/return .*/.../g" title?>
```
  Future<bool> canDeactivate(RouterState current, RouterState next) async {
    ...
  }
```

The `canNavigate()` method is more efficient to use because the router doesn't
need to precompute the (potential) next router state. Favor using `CanNavigate`
over `CanDeactivate` when possible.

<a id="on-activate"></a>
## *OnActivate* and *OnDeactivate* interfaces

Each route is handled by a component instance.
Generally, when the router processes a route change request, it
performs the following actions:

- It _deactivates_ and then destroys the component instance handling the
  current route, if any.
- It instantiates the component class registered to handle the new route
  instruction, and then _activates_ the new instance.

Lifecycle hooks exist for both component activation and deactivation. You've
been using the [OnActivate][] hook in the [hero list](3#on-activate) and the
crisis list components.

<a id="on-deactivate"></a>
Add [OnDeactivate][] to the list of classes implemented by `CrisisComponent`.
Add the following `onDeactivate()` hook, and add print statements to the contructor
and activate hook as shown:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis/crisis_component.dart (excerpt)" region="OnActivate-and-OnDeactivate" replace="/log\('/print('CrisisComponent: /g; /(canNavigate):.*(?=')/$1/g" title?>
```
  CrisisComponent(this._crisisService, this._router, this._dialogService) {
    print('CrisisComponent: created');
  }
  // ···
  void onActivate(_, RouterState current) async {
    print('CrisisComponent: onActivate: ${_?.toUrl()} -> ${current?.toUrl()}');
    // ···
  }
  // ···
  void onDeactivate(RouterState current, _) {
    print('CrisisComponent: onDeactivate: ${current?.toUrl()} -> ${_?.toUrl()}');
  }
  // ···
  Future<bool> canNavigate() async {
    print('CrisisComponent: canNavigate');
    return crisis?.name == name ||
        await _dialogService.confirm('Discard changes?');
  }
```

<i class="material-icons">open_in_browser</i>
**Refresh the browser** and open the JavaScript console.
Click the crises tab and select each of the first
three crises, one at a time. Finally, select _Cancel_ in the
crisis detail view. You should see the following sequence
of messages:

```nocode
CrisisComponent: created
CrisisComponent: onActivate: crises -> crises/1
CrisisComponent: canNavigate
CrisisComponent: onDeactivate: crises/1 -> crises/2
CrisisComponent: created
CrisisComponent: onActivate: crises/1 -> crises/2
CrisisComponent: canNavigate
CrisisComponent: onDeactivate: crises/2 -> crises/3
CrisisComponent: created
CrisisComponent: onActivate: crises/2 -> crises/3
```

When a component implements the [OnDeactivate][] interface,
the router calls the component's `onDeactivate()` method
before the instance is destroyed.
This gives component instances an opportunity
to perform tasks like cleanup and resource deallocation
before being deactivated.

Given the nature of a crisis detail component's responsibilities,
it seems wasteful to create a new instance each time. A single instance
could handle all crisis detail route instructions.

To tell the router that a component instance might be reusable,
use the [CanReuse][] lifecycle hook.

<a id="can-reuse"></a><a id="on-reuse"></a>
## *CanReuse* interface

Add `CanReuse` as a mixin so that it implements the [CanReuse][] interface,
and uses the `canReuse()` hook implementation that always returns true.

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis/crisis_component.dart (CanReuse)" replace="/extends \w+|with \w+/[!$&!]/g; /, InstanceLogger//g; /CanDeactivate, //g" title?>
```
  class CrisisComponent [!extends Object!]
      [!with CanReuse!]
      implements CanNavigate, OnActivate, OnDeactivate {
    // ···
  }
```

<i class="material-icons">open_in_browser</i> **Refresh the browser** and click
the crises tab, then select a few crises. You'll notice that crisis components
still get created after each crisis selection. This is because a component is
reusable only if its parent is reusable.

Add `CanReuse` as a mixin to the crisis list component:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis/crisis_list_component.dart (CanReuse)" replace="/extends \w+|with \w+/[!$&!]/g; /, InstanceLogger//g" title?>
```
  class CrisisListComponent [!extends Object!]
      [!with CanReuse!]
      implements OnActivate, OnDeactivate {
    // ···
  }
```

<i class="material-icons">open_in_browser</i>
**Refresh the browser** and select a few crises.
The view details should now reflect the selected crisis.
Also notice how the `OnDeactivate` hook is called only if you
navigate away from a crisis detail view &mdash; such as by clicking
crisis detail view _Cancel_ button, or clicking the _Heroes_ tab.

## *CanActivate*: requiring authentication

Apps often restrict access to a feature area based on who the user is.
You could permit access only to authenticated users or to users with a specific role.
You might block or limit access until the user's account is activated.

The `CanActivate` guard is the tool to manage these navigation business rules.

## Query Parameters and Fragments

In the [route parameters](#optional-route-parameters) example, you only dealt with parameters specific to
the route, but what if you wanted optional parameters available to all routes?
This is where query parameters come into play.

[Fragments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier) refer to certain elements on the page
identified with an `id` attribute.

Update the `AuthGuard` to provide a `session_id` query that will remain after navigating to another route.

Add an `anchor` element so you can jump to a certain point on the page.

Add the `NavigationExtras` object to the `router.navigate` method that navigates you to the `/login` route.

+makeExcerpt('app/auth-guard.service.4.ts (v3)', '')

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//- Material from the old router-deprecated page
## Milestone #4: Query Parameters

We use [*route parameters*](#route-parameters) to specify a *required* parameterized value *within* the route URL
as we do when navigating to the `HeroComponent` in order to view-and-edit the hero with *id:15*.

```bash
  localhost:3000/hero/15
```

Sometimes we wish to add *optional* information to a route request.
For example, the `HeroListComponent` doesn't need help to display a list of heroes.
But it might be nice if the previously-viewed hero were pre-selected when returning from the `HeroComponent`.
<img class="image-display" src="{% asset ng/devguide/router/selected-hero.png @path %}" alt="Selected hero">
That becomes possible if we can include hero Magneta's `id` in the URL when we
return from the `HeroComponent`, a scenario we'll pursue in a moment.

Optional information takes other forms. Search criteria are often loosely structured, e.g., `name='wind*'`.
Multiple values are common &mdash; `after='12/31/2015' & before='1/1/2017'` &mdash; in no particular order &mdash;
`before='1/1/2017' & after='12/31/2015'` &mdash; in a variety of formats &mdash; `during='currentYear'` .

These kinds of parameters don't fit easily in a URL *path*. Even if we could define a suitable URL token scheme,
doing so greatly complicates the pattern matching required to translate an incoming URL to a named route.

The **URL query string** is the ideal vehicle for conveying arbitrarily complex information during navigation.
The query string isn't involved in pattern matching and affords enormous flexibility of expression.
Almost anything serializable can appear in a query string.

The Component Router supports navigation with query strings as well as route parameters.
We define query string parameters in the *route parameters object* just like we do with route parameters.

<a id="route-or-query-parameter"></a>
### Route Parameters or Query Parameters?

There is no hard-and-fast rule. In general,

*prefer a route parameter when*
* the value is required.
* the value is necessary to distinguish one route path from another.

*prefer a query parameter when*
* the value is optional.
* the value is complex and/or multi-variate.

<a id="route-parameters-object"></a>
### Route parameters object

When navigating to the `HeroComponent` we specified the `id` of the hero-to-edit in the
*route parameters object* and made it the second item of the [*link parameters array*](#link-parameters-list).

<?xcode-excerpt "lib/src/hero/hero_list_component_1.dart (link-parameters-list)"?>

The router embedded the `id` value in the navigation URL because we had defined it
as a route parameter with an  `:id` placeholder token in the route `path`:

<?xcode-excerpt "lib/app_component_2.dart (hero-detail-route)"?>

When the user clicks the back button, the `HeroComponent` constructs another *link parameters array*
which it uses to navigate back to the `HeroListComponent`.

<?xcode-excerpt "lib/src/hero/hero_detail_component_1.dart (gotoHeroes)"?>

This array lacks a route parameter because we had no reason to send information to the `HeroListComponent`.

Now we have a reason. We'd like to send the id of the current hero with the navigation request so that the
`HeroListComponent` can highlight that hero in its list.

We do that with a route parameters object in the same manner as before.
We also defined a junk parameter (`foo`) that the `HeroListComponent` should ignore.
Here's the revised navigation statement:

<?xcode-excerpt "lib/src/hero/hero_component.dart (gotoHeroes-navigate)"?>

The app still works. Clicking "back" returns to the hero list view.

Look at the browser address bar.
<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
img(src="{% asset ng/devguide/plunker-separate-window-button.png @path %}" alt="pop out the window" align="right" style="margin-right:-20px")
  When running in plunker, pop out the preview window by clicking the blue 'X' button in the upper right corner.
</div>

It should look something like this, depending on where you run it:

```
  localhost:3000/heroes?id=15&foo=foo
```

The `id` value appears in the query string (`?id=15&foo=foo`), not in the URL path.
The path for the "Heroes" route doesn't have an `:id` token.

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  The router replaces route path tokens with corresponding values from the route parameters object.
  **Every parameter _not_ consumed by a route path goes in the query string.**
</div>

### Query parameters in the *RouteParams* service

The list of heroes is unchanged. No hero row is highlighted.

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  The {% example_ref %} *does* highlight the selected
  row because it demonstrates the final state of the app which includes the steps we're *about* to cover.
  At the moment we're describing the state of affairs *prior* to those steps.</div>

The `HeroListComponent` isn't expecting any parameters at all and wouldn't know what to do with them.
Let's change that.

When navigating from the `HeroListComponent` to the `HeroComponent`
the router picked up the route parameter object and made it available to the `HeroComponent`
in the `RouteParams` service. We injected that service in the constructor of the `HeroComponent`.

This time we'll be navigating in the opposite direction, from the `HeroComponent` to the `HeroListComponent`.

First we extend the router import statement to include the `RouteParams` service symbol;

<?xcode-excerpt "lib/src/hero/hero_list_component.dart (import)" region="import-route-params" title?>

Then we extend the constructor to inject the `RouteParams` service and extract the `id` parameter as the `selectedId`:

<?xcode-excerpt "lib/src/hero/hero_list_component.dart (constructor)" region="ctor" title?>

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  All route parameters are strings.
  The (+) in front of the `routeParameters.get` expression is a JavaScript trick to convert the string to an integer.
</div>

We add an `isSelected` method that returns true when a hero's id matches the selected id.

<?xcode-excerpt "lib/src/hero/hero_list_component.dart (isSelected)" title?>

Finally, we update our template with a [Class Binding](template-syntax#class-binding) to that `isSelected` method.
The binding adds the `selected` CSS class when the method returns `true` and removes it when `false`.
Look for it within the repeated `<li>` tag as shown here:

<?xcode-excerpt "lib/src/hero/hero_list_component.dart (template)" title?>

When the user navigates from the heroes list to the "Magneta" hero and back, "Magneta" appears selected:
<img class="image-display" src="{% asset ng/devguide/router/selected-hero.png @path %}" alt="Selected List">
The `foo` query string parameter is harmless and continues to be ignored.

### Child Routers and Query Parameters

We can define query parameters for child routers too.

The technique is precisely the same.
In fact, we made exactly the same changes to the *Crisis Center* feature.
Confirm the similarities in these *Hero* and *CrisisCenter* components,
arranged side-by-side for easy comparison:

+makeTabs(
  `router-deprecated/ts/app/heroes/hero-list.component.ts,
  router-deprecated/ts/app/crises/crisis-list.component.ts,
  router-deprecated/ts/app/heroes/hero-detail.component.ts,
  router-deprecated/ts/app/crises/crisis-detail.component.ts
  `,
  null,
  `hero-list.component.ts,
  crisis-list.component.ts,
  hero-detail.component.ts,
  crisis-detail.component.ts
  `)
When we navigate back from a `CrisisComponent` that is showing the *Asteroid* crisis,
we see that crisis properly selected in the list like this:

<img class="image-display" src="{% asset ng/devguide/router/selected-crisis.png @path %}" alt="Selected crisis">

**Look at the browser address bar again**. It's *different*. It looks something like this:

```bash
localhost:3000/crises/;id=3;foo=foo
```

The query string parameters are no longer separated by "?" and "&".
They are **separated by semicolons (;)**
This is *matrix URL* notation &mdash; something we may not have seen before.

//- Chalin: note that this is placed earlier in the new router guide.
<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  *Matrix URL* notation is an idea first floated
  in a [1996 proposal](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs.html) by the founder of the web, Tim Berners-Lee.

  Although matrix notation never made it into the HTML standard, it is legal and
  it became popular among browser routing systems as a way to isolate parameters
  belonging to parent and child routes. The Angular Component Router is such a system.

  The syntax may seem strange to us but users are unlikely to notice or care
  as long as the URL can be emailed and pasted into a browser address bar
  as this one can.</div>
