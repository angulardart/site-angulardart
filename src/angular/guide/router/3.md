You've seen how to navigate using the `RouterLink` directive,
now you'll learn how to

- Organize the app into *features*, or *feature groups*
- Navigate imperatively from one component to another
- Pass required and optional information in route parameters

This example has capabilities very similar to the
[Tour of Heroes Tutorial Part 5](/angular/tutorial/toh-pt5),
and you'll be copying much of the code from there.

Here's how the user will experience this version of the app:

<img class="image-display" src="{% asset ng/devguide/router/router-2-anim.gif @path %}" alt="App in action">

A typical app has multiple *features* or *feature groups*,
each dedicated to a particular business purpose.

While you could continue to add files to the `lib/src` folder,
developers generally prefer to organize their apps so that most, if not all,
files implementing a feature are grouped into a separate folder.

You are about to break up the app into different feature groups, each with its own concerns.

## Heroes functionality

Follow these steps:

1. Create a `hero` folder under `lib/src` &mdash; you'll be adding files implementing *hero management* there.
1. Copy the following files from [toh-5 `lib/src`]({{site.ghNgEx}}/toh-5/tree/{{site.branch}}/lib/src)
  into the new `hero` folder, adjusting import paths as necessary:
  - `hero.dart`
  - `hero_component.*`, that is, the CSS, Dart and HTML files
  - `hero_service.dart`
  - `hero_list_component.*`, the CSS, Dart and HTML files
  - `mock_heroes.dart`
1. In `hero_list_component.html`, rename the `<ul>` element class to `items` (from `heroes`).
1. In `app_component.dart`,
   import and then add `ClassProvider(HeroService)` to the `providers` list
   so that the service is available everywhere in the app.
1. In `src/routes.dart`, adjust the hero component import path because the new file is under `heroes`.
1. Delete the old `lib/src/hero_list_component.dart`.

<i class="material-icons">open_in_browser</i>
**Refresh the browser** and you should see heroes in the heroes list.
You can select heroes, but not yet view hero details. You'll address that next.

## Hero routing requirements

The heroes feature has two interacting components, the hero list and the hero detail.
The list view is self-sufficient; you navigate to it, it gets a list of heroes and displays them.

The detail view is different. It displays a particular hero. It can't know which hero to show on its own.
That information must come from outside.

When the user selects a hero from the list, the app should navigate to the detail view
and show that hero.
You tell the detail view which hero to display by including the selected hero's ID in the route URL.

## Hero detail route

Create a hero route path and route definition like you did in the [Tour of
Heroes Tutorial Part 5](/angular/tutorial/toh-pt5). Adding the following route
path and `getId()` helper function:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/route_paths.dart (hero)" replace="/hero\b/[!$&!]/g" title?>
```
  const idParam = 'id';

  class RoutePaths {
    // ···
    static final [!hero!] = RoutePath(path: '${heroes.path}/:$idParam');
  }

  int getId(Map<String, String> parameters) {
    final id = parameters[idParam];
    return id == null ? null : int.tryParse(id);
  }
```

After including an appropriate import for `HeroComponent`, add the following
route definition:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/routes_3.dart (hero)" replace="/import.*|RouteDef[\S\s]+?\);|\bhero,/[!$&!]/g" title?>
```
  [!import 'hero/hero_component.template.dart' as hero_template;!]
  // ···
  class Routes {
    // ···
    static final hero = [!RouteDefinition(
      routePath: RoutePaths.hero,
      component: hero_template.HeroComponentNgFactory,
    );!]

    static final all = <RouteDefinition>[
      // ···
      [!hero,!]
      // ···
    ];
  }
```

## Route definition with a parameter

Notice that the hero path ends with `:id` (the result of interpolating 
`idParam` in the path `'${heroes.path}/:$idParam'`).
That creates a slot in the path for a [route parameter.][RouterState.parameters]
In this case, the router will insert the ID of a hero into that slot.

If you tell the router to navigate to the detail component and display "Magneta" (having ID 15),
you'd expect a hero ID to appear in the browser URL like this:
[localhost:8080/#/heroes/15](localhost:8080/#/heroes/15).

If a user enters that URL into the browser address bar, the router should recognize the
pattern and go to the same "Magneta" detail view.

<a id="navigate"></a>
## Navigating imperatively

Users *won't* navigate to the hero component by clicking a link
so you won't be adding a new `RouterLink` anchor tag to the shell.
Instead, when the user *clicks* a hero in the list, you'll ask the router
to navigate to the hero view for the selected hero.

Make the following changes to the hero list component template:

- Drop "My" from the `<h2>` element in the template so it reads "Heroes".
- Drop the `<div *ngIf="selectedHero != null">...</div>` element.

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/hero/hero_list_component.html" title?>
```
  <h2>Heroes</h2>
  <ul class="items">
    <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes"
      [class.selected]="hero === selected"
      (click)="onSelect(hero)">
      <span class="badge">{!{hero.id}!}</span> {!{hero.name}!}
    </li>
  </ul>
```

The template has an `*ngFor` element that [you've seen before](../displaying-data#ngFor).
There's a `(click)` [event binding](../template-syntax#event-binding) to the component's
`onSelect()` method to which you'll add a call to `gotoDetail()`.

But first, make `gotoDetail()` **private** by prefixing the name with an
underscore, since it won't be used in the template anymore:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/hero/hero_list_component.dart (_gotoDetail)" replace="/int id//g; /_gotoDetail/[!$&!]/g" title?>
```
  Future<NavigationResult> [!_gotoDetail!]() =>
      _router.navigate(_heroUrl(id));
```

The `onSelect()` method is currently defined as follows:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/hero/hero_list_component_0.dart (onSelect)"?>
```
  void onSelect(Hero hero) => selected = hero;
```

By selecting a hero in the hero list, the router will navigate _away_ from the
hero list view _to_ a hero view. Because of this, you don't need to record the
selected hero in the hero list component. Just navigate to the selected hero's
view.

First parameterize `_gotoDetail()` with a hero ID, then update the `onSelect()`
method as follows:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/hero/hero_list_component.dart (onSelect & _gotoDetail)" replace="/_gotoDetail\(.*?\)/[!$&!]/g" title?>
```
  void onSelect(Hero hero) => [!_gotoDetail(hero.id)!];
  // ···
  Future<NavigationResult> [!_gotoDetail(int id)!] =>
      _router.navigate(_heroUrl(id));
```

<i class="material-icons">open_in_browser</i> **Refresh the browser** and select
a hero. The app navigates to the hero view.

## Navigating back and selecting a hero

Use a [route parameter][RouterState.parameters] to specify a _required_
parameter _within_ the route path, for example, when navigating to the
detail for the hero with ID 15: [/heroes/15](localhost:8080/#/heroes/15).

You sometimes want to add _optional_ information to a route request.
For example, when returning to the heroes list from the hero detail view,
it would be nice if the viewed hero was preselected in the list:

<img class="image-display" src="{% asset ng/devguide/router/selected-hero.png @path %}" alt="Selected hero" width="250px">

You can achieve this by passing an optional ID as a _query parameter_ when
navigating back to the hero list. You'll address that next.

### Location service _back()_

The hero detail's _Back_ button has an event binding to the
[goBack()](/angular/tutorial/toh-pt5#find-the-way-back) method, which currently navigates
backward one step in the browser's history stack using the `Location` service:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/hero/hero_component_0.dart (goBack)"?>
```
  void goBack() => _location.back();
```

### Router navigation

You'll be implementing `goBack()` using the router rather than the location
service, so you can **replace** the `Location` field by `Router _router`,
initialized in the constructor:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/hero/hero_component.dart (router)" title?>
```
  final Router _router;

  HeroComponent(this._heroService, this._router);
```

Use the router's `navigate()` method like you did [previously](#navigate) in
`HeroListComponent`, but encode the hero ID as a query parameter instead:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/hero/hero_component.dart (goBack)" title?>
```
  Future<NavigationResult> goBack() => _router.navigate(
      RoutePaths.heroes.toUrl(),
      NavigationParams(queryParameters: {idParam: '${hero.id}'}));
```

<i class="material-icons">open_in_browser</i>
**Refresh the browser**, select a hero and then click the _Back_ button to return to the heroes list.
Notice that the URL now ends with a query parameter like this: `/#/heroes?id=15`.

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  The router can also encode parameters using the
  [matrix URL notation](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs),
  such as `/heroes;id=15;foo=bar`. You'll see this
  [later](4), once the crises feature is fully fleshed out.
</div>

<a id="on-activate"></a>
### Extracting query parameters

Despite the URL query parameter, the hero isn't selected. Using the hero
component as a model, make the following changes to the hero list component:

- Implement `OnActivate` rather than `OnNgInit`.
- Replace `ngOnInit()` by `onActivate()`, a _[router lifecycle hook](5)_. Read about
  other router lifecycle hooks in [Milestone 5](5).
- Fetch the hero ID from the router state `queryParameters`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/hero/hero_list_component.dart (onActivate)" title?>
```
  @override
  void onActivate(_, RouterState current) async {
    await _getHeroes();
    selected = _select(current);
  }

  Hero _select(RouterState routerState) {
    final id = getId(routerState.queryParameters);
    return id == null
        ? null
        : heroes.firstWhere((e) => e.id == id, orElse: () => null);
  }
```

<i class="material-icons">open_in_browser</i>
**Refresh the browser**, select a hero and then click the _Back_ button to return to the heroes list.
The previously selected hero will be selected again. Try deep linking to another selected hero
by visiting this URL: [localhost:8080/#/hero?id=15](localhost:8080/#/hero?id=15).
