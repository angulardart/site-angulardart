{% comment %}NOTE: this page currently skips named outlets and the associated functionality of the `ComposeMessageComponent`.{% endcomment %}

It's time to add real functionality to the app's current placeholder crisis center.
As a quick way to upgrade the basic functionality of the crisis center:

- Delete the placeholder crisis center component file.
- Create a `lib/src/crisis_center` folder.
- Copy the files from `lib/src/heroes` into the new crisis center folder, but
- Change every mention of "hero" to "crisis", and "heroes" to "crises".
- Define the following mock crises:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis_center/mock_crises.dart" title?>
```
  import 'crisis.dart';

  final List<Crisis> mockCrises = [
    new Crisis(1, 'Dragon Burning Cities'),
    new Crisis(2, 'Sky Rains Great White Sharks'),
    new Crisis(3, 'Giant Asteroid Heading For Earth'),
    new Crisis(4, 'Procrastinators Meeting Delayed Again')
  ];
```

This will result in `Crisis` instances having an `id` and a `name`,
`CrisesComponent` displaying lists of crises, etc.
Such a quick upgrade will free you to next focus on exploring new router
capabilities while adding crisis center features.

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  If you'd like to **test** this sizable refactoring before moving on, **_temporarily_** edit
  `app_component.dart`:

  - Let the `CrisesComponent` handle the `CrisisCenter` route
  - Add the `CrisisService` to the `providers` list

  **Refresh the browser** and ensure that the app's hero features work as
  they did before, and that the crisis center lists crises.  You won't be
  able to select a crisis until you've added the appropriate crisis routes
  &mdash; something you'll be doing soon.

  Remember to undo these temporary changes before moving on.
</div>

This section introduces the following new ideas and techniques into the crisis center design:

* The route URLs will branch into child route trees that parallel the component trees in the feature areas.
* In keeping with *Separation of Concerns*,
  changes to a feature module such as *Crisis Center* won't require changes to the `AppComponent` or
  any other feature's components.

{% comment %}This is covered in milestone 5:
* The router will prevent navigation away from the detail view while there are pending, unsaved changes.
* The user will be able to cancel unwanted changes.
* The router will block access to certain features until the user logs-in.
{% endcomment %}

Leave *Heroes* in its current state as a contrast with the *Crisis Center*.
You can decide later if the differences are worthwhile.

## A Crisis center with child routes

You'll organize the crisis center to conform to the following recommended pattern for Angular applications:

* Each feature area in its own folder
* Each area with its own area root component
* Each area root component with its own router outlet and child routes
* Area routes rarely (if ever) cross

If your app had many feature areas, the app component trees might look like this:

<img class="image-display" src="{% asset_path 'ng/devguide/router/component-tree.png' %}" alt="Component Tree">

## Parent route configuration

Let the app component know that the crisis center will be an area route component managing
its own child routes. To do this, mark the `CrisisCenter` route definition as
a **_non-terminal route_** by applying the `/...` suffix to its path:

{% comment %}stylePattern = { otl: /(path: '.*\.\.\.'),$/gm }{% endcomment %}
<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component_4.dart (routes)" title?>
```
  @RouteConfig(const [
    const Redirect(path: '/', redirectTo: const ['Heroes']),
    const Redirect(path: '/index.html', redirectTo: const ['Heroes']),
    const Route(
        path: '/crisis-center/...',
        name: 'CrisisCenter',
        component: CrisisCenterComponent),
    const Route(path: '/heroes', name: 'Heroes', component: HeroesComponent),
    const Route(
        path: '/hero/:id', name: 'HeroDetail', component: HeroDetailComponent),
    // Not yet used: const AuxRoute(path: '/contact', name: 'Contact', component: ComposeMessageComponent),
    const Route(path: '/**', name: 'NotFound', component: NotFoundComponent)
  ])
  class AppComponent {}
```

## Child routing component

Here is the new crisis center component code replacing the current mock implementation
(make sure to put the new implementation in the `crisis_center` folder):

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis_center/crisis_center_component_2.dart" title?>
```
  import 'package:angular2/angular2.dart';
  import 'package:angular2/router.dart';

  import 'crisis_service.dart';
  import 'crises_component.dart';

  @Component(
      selector: 'crisis-center',
      template: '''
        <router-outlet></router-outlet>
      ''',
      directives: const [ROUTER_DIRECTIVES],
      providers: const [CrisisService])
  @RouteConfig(const [
    const Route(
        path: '/...',
        name: 'Crises',
        component: CrisesComponent,
        useAsDefault: true)
  ])
  class CrisisCenterComponent {}
```

{% comment %}
//- Dart differences relative to the TS sample:
* `CrisisCenterComponent` has no `<h2>` element, only a router outlet.
  The `<h2>` is kept in the `CrisesComponent`.

TODO: mention the need for useAsDefault?
{% endcomment %}

The `CrisisCenterComponent` has a single non-terminal route handled by the
`CrisesComponent`. This means that the `CrisesComponent` is a parent component
as well; you'll define its child routes below.

Much like the `AppComponent`, the `CrisisCenterComponent` is the

- *Root* of the crisis center area,
just as `AppComponent` is the root of the entire application
- *Shell* for the crisis management feature area,
just as the `AppComponent` is a shell to manage the high-level workflow

Like most shells, the `CrisisCenterComponent` class is very simple, simpler even than `AppComponent`:
it has no business logic, and its template has no links, just a
`<router-outlet>` for the crisis center child views.

<div class="callout is-helpful" markdown="1">
  <header> Service isolation</header>
  `CrisisService` is declared in the `CrisisCenterComponent` providers list.
  This step limits the scope of the service to app component subtree rooted at the crisis center component.
  No component outside of the crisis center needs access to the `CrisisService`.
</div>

## Child route configuration

The `CrisisCenterComponent` is a *routing component* like the `AppComponent`.
It has its own router outlet and its own child route. The single child
route is a non-terminal route handled by the `CrisesComponent`.

You'll now also turn the `CrisesComponent` into a routing component so that
you can explore new router features. Add a `<router-outlet>` element to the
end of the crises component template:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis_center/crises_component.html" title?>
```
  <h2>Crises</h2>
  <ul class="items">
    <li *ngFor="let crisis of crises"
      [class.selected]="crisis === selectedCrisis"
      (click)="onSelect(crisis)">
      <span class="badge">{!{crisis.id}!}</span> {!{crisis.name}!}
    </li>
  </ul>
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
```

The crises component displays details of a selected crisis.
What should it display when no crisis is selected?
For this purpose, create the following component in the `crisis_center` folder:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis_center/crisis_center_home_component.dart" title?>
```
  import 'package:angular2/angular2.dart';

  @Component(
      selector: 'crisis-center-home',
      template: '<p>Welcome to the Crisis Center</p>')
  class CrisisCenterHomeComponent {}
```

With this in place, you can now add the `CrisesComponent` router config:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis_center/crises_component.dart (routes)" title?>
```
  @RouteConfig(const [
    const Route(
        path: '/',
        name: 'CrisesHome',
        component: CrisisCenterHomeComponent,
        useAsDefault: true),
    const Route(
        path: '/:id', name: 'CrisisDetail', component: CrisisDetailComponent),
  ])
  class CrisesComponent implements OnInit {
  /* . . . */
  }
```

These two routes navigate to the crisis center child components,
`CrisisCenterHomeComponent` and `CrisisDetailComponent`, respectively.

Being _child routes_, there are some *important differences* in the way the router treats them:

- The router displays the components of these routes in the router outlet
  of the `CrisesComponent`, not in the router outlet of the `AppComponent` shell.
- At the top level, paths that begin with `/` refer to the root of the application.
  But child routes *extend* the path of the parent route.
  With each step down the route tree,
  you add a slash followed by the route path, unless the path is _empty_.

Apply that logic to navigation within the crisis center for which the parent path is `/crisis-center`.

* To navigate to the `CrisisCenterHomeComponent`, the full URL is `/crisis-center` (`/crisis-center` + `''` + `''`).

* To navigate to the `CrisisDetailComponent` for a crisis with `id=2`, the full URL is
`/crisis-center/2` (`/crisis-center` + `''` +  `'/2'`).

The absolute URL for the latter example, including the `localhost` origin, is

<?code-excerpt?>
```
  localhost:3000/crisis-center/2
```

{% comment %}
TODO: The default is different for Dart. We'll need to explicitly allow reuse.
The `Crisis Detail` route is a child of the `Crisis List`. Since the router [reuses components](#reuse)
by default, the `Crisis Detail` component will be re-used as you select different crises.
In contrast, back in the `Hero Detail` route, the component was recreated each time you selected a different hero.
{% endcomment %}

Looking at the `CrisisCenterComponent` or the `CrisesComponent` alone,
you can't tell that they are _child_ routing components.
You can't tell that their routes are child routes, indistinguiable from top level application routes.
This is intentional, and it makes it easier to reuse component routers.
What makes a component a child router of our application is determined by the parent route configuration.

**Refresh the browser** and try the new crisis center implementation. You should be able
to select crises and see their details. Unfortunately, the crisis details _Back_ button
doesn't work yet. You'll fix that next.

{% comment %}TODO: consider moving this subsection into the appendix on link parameters list{% endcomment %}

## Relative navigation

Before addressing the faulty crisis details _Back_ button, you'll need to understand
relative route nativation.

Suppose that you'd like to add a "Find help!" button, in the crisis details view,
that would navigate to the heroes list by means of a router link directive. You
might try something like this, but **Angular will report an error**:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis_center/crisis_detail_component_1.html (erroneous link)" region="erroneous-heroes-route" title?>
```
  <button [routerLink]="['Heroes']">Find help (ERRONEOUS LINK)!</button>
```

By **_default_, the router looks for the named route** (`'Heroes'`) in the collection
of sibling and child routes of the component containing the link parameters list.
In this case, a crisis details component has no child routes, and its parent component
(`CrisisCenterComponent`), has routes but none of their names match `'Heroes'`.

The router supports **directory-like syntax** in a _link parameters list_ to help guide route name lookup.
The following syntax can be applied as a prefix to the first route name in the parameters list:

- `'/RouteName'` instructs the router to look for the named route in the app root.
- `'./RouteName'` instructs the router to search this component's routes.
- `'../RouteName'` causes the router to search the routes of this component's parent.
  This prefix can be repeated to move up the component tree, using `../../`, etc.
- `'RouteName'` &mdash; in the absence of any prefix, the router falls back to the _default_ search
  mentioned above, attempting to match the given name with this component's child and sibling routes.

Returning to our "Find help!" button link, you could successfully use either
of these route names:

- `'/Heroes'` works because the root `AppComponent` has a route named `Heroes`.
- `'../../../Heroes'` works because the ancestors of a crisis details are
  `CrisesComponent`, `CrisisCenterComponent` and `AppComponent`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis_center/crisis_detail_component_1.html (valid relative link)" region="valid-relative-route"?>
```
  <button [routerLink]="['../../../Heroes']">Find help!</button>
```

The currently faulty crisis details view _Back_ button has an event binding to this method:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis_center/crisis_detail_component_0.dart (goBack)" title?>
```
  Future goBack() => _router.navigate([
        'Crises',
        crisis == null ? {} : {'id': crisis.id.toString()}
      ]);
```

Given that the named route (`Crises`) has no lookup prefix, the router does a default search
for `Crises` in the crisis details component and the crises component. Neither
have a route named `Crises`, but the `CrisisCenterComponent` does. So you could
use relative nativation to direct the router to the crisis center, or simply use
default lookup with the `CrisesHome` route name:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/crisis_center/crisis_detail_component_1.dart (goBack)"?>
```
  Future goBack() => _router.navigate([
        'CrisesHome', // or '../../Crises',
        crisis == null ? {} : {'id': crisis.id.toString()}
      ]);
```

**Refresh the browser**, select a crisis and ensure that the _Back_ button causes
the crisis details view to be replaced by the crisis center home message.

## Displaying multiple routes in named outlets

You decide to give users a way to contact the crisis center.
When a user clicks a "Contact" button, you want to display a message in a popup view.

The popup should stay open, even when switching between pages in the application, until the user closes it
by sending the message or canceling.
Clearly you can't put the popup in the same outlet as the other pages.

Until now, you've defined a single outlet and you've nested child routes
under that outlet to group routes together.
The router only supports one primary _unnamed_ outlet per template,
but a template can also have any number of _named_ outlets.
Each named outlet has its own set of routes with their own components.
Multiple outlets can be displaying different content, determined by different routes, all at the same time.

Add an outlet named "popup" in the `AppComponent`, directly below the unnamed outlet.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component_4.dart (outlets)" title?>
```
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
  <router-outlet name="popup"></router-outlet>
```

That's where a popup will go, once you learn how to route a popup component to it.

<div id="secondary-routes"></div>
### Secondary routes

Named outlets are the targets of  _secondary routes_.

Secondary routes look like primary routes and you configure them the same way.
They differ in a few key respects.

* They are independent of each other
* They work in combination with other routes.
* They are displayed in named outlets.

Create a new component named `ComposeMessageComponent` in `lib/compose_message_component.dart`.
It displays a simple form with a header, an input box for the message,
and two buttons, "Send" and "Cancel".

<img class="image-display" src="{% asset_path 'ng/devguide/router/contact-popup.png' %}" alt="Contact popup" width="250">

Here's the component and its template:

+makeTabs(
  `router/ts/app/compose-message.component.ts,
  router/ts/app/compose-message.component.html`,
    null,
  `app/compose-message.component.ts,
  app/compose-message.component.html`)

It looks about the same as any other component you've seen in this guide.
There are two noteworthy differences

Note that the `send` method simulates latency by waiting a second before "sending" the message and closing the popup.

The `closePopup` method closes the popup view by navigating to the "popup" outlet with a `null`.
That's a peculiarity covered [below](#clear-secondary-routes).

As with other application components, you add the `ComposeMessageComponent` to the `declarations` of an `NgModule`.
Do so in the `AppModule`.

### Add a secondary route

Open the `AppRoutingModule` and add a new `compose` route to the `appRoutes`.
<?xcode-excerpt "lib/src/app_routing_module_3.dart (compose route)" region="compose" title?>

The `path` and `component` properties should be familiar.
There's a new property `outlet` set to `'popup'`.
This route now targets the "popup" outlet and the `ComposeMessageComponent` will display there.

The user needs a way to open the popup.
Open the `AppComponent` and add a "Contact" link.

<?xcode-excerpt "lib/app_component_4.dart (contact-link)" title?>

Although the `compose` route is pinned to the "popup" outlet, that's not sufficient for wiring the route to a `RouterLink` directive.
You have to specify the named outlet in a _link parameters array_ and bind it to the `RouterLink` with a property binding.

The _link parameters array_ contains an object with a single `outlets` property whose value
is another object keyed by one (or more) outlet names.
In this case there is only the "popup" outlet property and its value is another _link parameters array_ that specifies the `compose` route.

You are in effect saying, _when the user clicks this link, display the component associated with the `compose` route in the `popup` outlet_.

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  This `outlets` object within an outer object was completely unnecessary
  when there was only one route and one _unnamed_ outlet to think about.

  The router assumed that your route specification targeted the _unnamed_ primary outlet
  and created these objects for you.

  Routing to a named outlet has revealed a previously hidden router truth:
  you can target multiple outlets with multiple routes in the same `RouterLink` directive.

  You're not actually doing that here.
  But to target a named outlet, you must use the richer, more verbose syntax.
</div>

h3#secondary-route-navigation <i>Secondary Route Navigation</i>: merging routes during navigation

Navigate to the _Crisis Center_ and click "Contact".
you should see something like the following URL in the browser address bar.

<?code-excerpt?>
```
  http://<host:port>/<something>/crisis-center(popup:compose)
```

The interesting part of the URL follows the `<something>`:

* The `crisis-center` is the primary navigation.
* Parentheses surround the secondary route.
* The secondary route consist of an outlet name (`popup`), then a `colon` separator, followed with the secondary route path (`compose`)

Click the _Heroes_ link and look at the URL again.

<?code-excerpt?>
```
  http://<host:port>/<something>/heroes(popup:compose)
```

The primary navigation part has changed; the secondary route is the same.

The router is keeping track of two separate branches in a navigation tree and generating a representation of that tree in the URL.

You can add many more outlets and routes, at the top level and in nested levels, creating a navigation tree with many branches.
The router will generate the URL to go with it.

You can tell the router to navigate an entire tree at once by filling out the `outlets` object mentioned above.
Then pass that object inside a _link parameters array_  to the `router.navigate` method.

Experiment with these possibilities at your leisure.

<div id="clear-secondary-routes"></div>
### Clearing Secondary Routes
As you've learned, a component in an outlet persists until you navigate away to a new component.
Secondary outlets are no different in this regard.

Each secondary outlet has its own navigation, independent of the navigation driving the primary outlet.
Changing a current route that displays in the primary outlet has no effect on the "popup" outlet.
That's why the "popup" stays visible as you navigate among the crises and heroes.

Clicking the "send" or "cancel" buttons _does_ clear the popup view.
To see how, look at the `ComposeMessageComponent.closePopup` method again:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/compose_message_component.dart (closePopup)" title?>
```
    void closePopup() {
      _router.navigate([
        {
          'outlets': {'popup': null}
        }
      ]);
    }
  }
```

It navigates imperatively with the `Router.navigate` method, passing in a [link parameters array](#link-parameters-array).

Like the array bound to the _Contact_ `RouterLink` in the `AppComponent`,
this one includes an object with an `outlets` property.
The `outlets` property value is another object with outlet names for keys.
The only named outlet is `'popup'`.

This time, the value of `'popup'` is `null`. That's not a route, but it is a legitimate value.
Setting _popup_ `RouterOutlet` to `null` clears the outlet and removes the secondary "popup" route from the current URL.
