## Default route

The initial URL in the browser bar after the app launches is something like [localhost:8080](localhost:8080).

That doesn't match any of the configured routes, which means that the app won't
display any component when it's launched.
The user must click one of the links to trigger a navigation and component display.

It would be nicer if the app had a **_default_ route**
that displayed the list of heroes immediately.
One way to achieve this is to add `useAsDefault: true` as an argument
to the `Heroes` route definition:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/routes_2.dart (useAsDefault)" replace="/useAs.*?(?=,)/[!$&!]/g" title?>
```
  static final heroes = RouteDefinition(
    routePath: RoutePaths.heroes,
    component: hero_list_template.HeroListComponentNgFactory,
    [!useAsDefault: true!],
  );
```

<i class="material-icons">open_in_browser</i>
**Refresh the browser** and try it. Notice that the heroes list is displayed
when the app launches, but that the URL path is `/`.

## Redirect route

As an alternative solution, **remove** the `useAsDefault` argument that you just added,
and instead add a _redirect_ route that will translate an initial relative path (`'/'`)
to the desired default path (`/#/heroes`).

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/routes_2.dart (redirect)" title?>
```
  static final all = <RouteDefinition>[
    // ···
    RouteDefinition.redirect(
      path: '',
      redirectTo: RoutePaths.heroes.toUrl(),
    ),
    // ···
  ];
```

<i class="material-icons">open_in_browser</i>
**Refresh the browser** and try it. Now the browser address bar path is `/#/heroes`
as if you'd navigated there directly.

## Wildcard route

While you've created routes to `/#/crises` and `/#/heroes`,
what if the router is given another path?
Add a **wildcard** route so that all other paths are handled
by a "Not Found" (404) component:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/routes_2.dart (wildcard)" title?>
```
  static final all = <RouteDefinition>[
    // ···
    RouteDefinition(
      path: '.+',
      component: not_found_template.NotFoundComponentNgFactory,
    ),
  ];
```

The path regular expression `'.+'` matches every non-empty path.
(Exclude the empty path so that it triggers the `useAsDefault` route you defined earlier.)
The router will select the wildcard route if it can't match a route earlier in the routes list.

## App code {#wrap-up}

In this short iteration you've tried default, redirect and wildcard routes.
