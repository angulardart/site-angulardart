<?code-excerpt path-base="examples/ng/doc/toh-2"?>

In this page, you'll expand the Tour of Heroes app to display a list of heroes, and
allow users to select a hero and display the hero's details.

When you're done with this page, the app should look like this {% example_ref %}.

## Where you left off

Before you continue with this page of the Tour of Heroes,
verify that you have the following structure after [The Hero Editor](toh-pt1) page.
If your structure doesn't match, go back to that page to figure out what you missed.

<div class="ul-filetree" markdown="1">
- angular_tour_of_heroes
  - lib
    - app_component.dart
    - hero.dart
  - test
    - app_test.dart
  - web
    - index.html
    - main.dart
    - styles.css
  - analysis_options.yaml
  - pubspec.yaml
</div>

{% include_relative _keep-app-running.md %}

## App refactoring

Before adding new features, you'll benefit from refactoring the app a little.

### App template file

You'll be making several updates to the app component's template.
First, move the template to its own file:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component_1.html" title?>
```
  <h1>{!{title}!}</h1>
  <h2>{!{hero.name}!}</h2>
  <div><label>id: </label>{!{hero.id}!}</div>
  <div>
    <label>name: </label>
    <input [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name">
  </div>
```

Replace the `@Component` `template` parameter by a `templateUrl` referring
to the new template file:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.dart (templateUrl)" replace="/templateUrl.*/[!$&!]/g" title?>
```
  @Component(
    selector: 'my-app',
    [!templateUrl: 'app_component.html',!]
    // ···
  )
```

<i class="material-icons">open_in_browser</i>
 **Refresh the browser,** and the app still runs.

### Hero class

It is good practice to place [implementation files][] under the `lib/src`
folder. Make the following changes to your project:

- Create the `lib/src` folder.
- Move `hero.dart` into `lib/src`.
- In the app component, adjust the import path to the hero file.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.dart (hero import)" title?>
```
  import 'src/hero.dart';
```

<i class="material-icons">open_in_browser</i>
 **Refresh the browser.** The app still runs, and you are now ready to add new features.

## Displaying heroes

To display a list of heroes, you'll add heroes to the view's template.

### Mock heroes

Create a list of ten heroes in the following file under `lib/src`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/src/mock_heroes.dart" title?>
```
  import 'hero.dart';

  final mockHeroes = <Hero>[
    Hero(11, 'Mr. Nice'),
    Hero(12, 'Narco'),
    Hero(13, 'Bombasto'),
    Hero(14, 'Celeritas'),
    Hero(15, 'Magneta'),
    Hero(16, 'RubberMan'),
    Hero(17, 'Dynama'),
    Hero(18, 'Dr IQ'),
    Hero(19, 'Magma'),
    Hero(20, 'Tornado')
  ];
```

Eventually this app will fetch the list of heroes from a web service, but for now
you can display mock heroes.

### App _heroes_ field

Replace the `hero` field with a `heroes` field in `AppComponent`,
and initialize it with mock heroes (don't forget the import):

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.dart (heroes)" title?>
```
  import 'src/mock_heroes.dart';

  // ···
  class AppComponent {
    final title = 'Tour of Heroes';
    List<Hero> heroes = mockHeroes;
    // ···
  }
```

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  The hero data is separated from the class implementation
  because ultimately the hero names will come from a data service.
</div>

### Display hero names in a template

To display the hero names in an unordered list, **replace** _all_ of the current
template with the following HTML:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html" remove="/selected|click|div|name/" replace="/(\s+)(.li) .*/$1$2\x3E$1  \x3C!-- each hero goes here --\x3E/g" title?>
```
  <h1>{!{title}!}</h1>
  <h2>Heroes</h2>
  <ul class="heroes">
    <li>
      <!-- each hero goes here -->
    </li>
  </ul>
```

Next you'll add hero names.

### List heroes with _ngFor_

The goal is to bind the list of heroes in the component to the template, iterate over them,
and display them individually.

Modify the `<li>` tag by adding the core directive `*ngFor`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html" retain="ngFor" replace="/ngFor.*/$&\x3E/g"?>
```
  <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes">
```

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  The (`*`) prefix to `ngFor` is a critical part of this syntax.
  It indicates that the `<li>` element and its children
  constitute a master template.

  The `ngFor` directive iterates over the component's `heroes` list
  and renders an instance of this template for each hero in that list.

  The `let hero` part of the expression identifies `hero` as the  template input variable,
  which holds the current hero item for each iteration.
  You can reference this variable within the template to access the current hero's properties.

  Read more about `ngFor` and template input variables in the
  [Showing a list property with *ngFor](../guide/displaying-data#ngFor) section of the
  [Displaying Data](../guide/displaying-data) page and the
  [ngFor](../guide/template-syntax#ngFor) section of the
  [Template Syntax](../guide/template-syntax) page.
</div>

Within the `<li>` element, add content
that uses the `hero` template variable to display the hero's properties.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html" retain="/\bli\b|span/" replace="/ngFor.*/$&\x3E/g" title?>
```
  <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes">
    <span class="badge">{!{hero.id}!}</span> {!{hero.name}!}
  </li>
```

To use an Angular directive in a
template requires that it be listed in the `directives` argument of your
component's `@Component` annotation. Similar to what you did in [part 1][],
add all [coreDirectives][]:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.dart (directives)" title?>
```
  @Component(
    selector: 'my-app',
    // ···
    directives: [coreDirectives, formDirectives],
  )
```

<i class="material-icons">open_in_browser</i>
**Refresh the browser**, and a list of heroes appears.

### Style the heroes

Users should get a visual cue of which hero they are hovering over and which hero is selected.

To add styles to your component, you _could_ set the `styles` argument of the `@Component` annotation:

```dart
// NOT recommended when adding many CSS classes:
styles: [
  '''
    .selected { ... }
    .heroes { ... }
    ...
  '''
],
```

But this makes the Dart file longer and less readable when adding many styles.
Instead, place the styles in a `.css` file, and refer to the file using the
`styleUrls` argument to `@Component`. By convention, the names of the
component's CSS and Dart files have the same base (`app_component`).

<code-tabs>
  <?code-pane "lib/app_component.dart (styleUrls)" linenums?>
  <?code-pane "lib/app_component.css" linenums?>
</code-tabs>

When you assign styles to a component, they are scoped to that specific component.
These styles apply only to the `AppComponent` and don't affect the outer HTML.

The template for displaying heroes should look like this:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html" remove="/div|label|[Ss]elect/" replace="/ngFor.*/$&\x3E/g; /class=[^\x3E]+/[!$&!]/g" title?>
```
  <h1>{!{title}!}</h1>
  <h2>Heroes</h2>
  <ul [!class="heroes"!]>
    <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes">
      <span [!class="badge"!]>{!{hero.id}!}</span> {!{hero.name}!}
    </li>
  </ul>
```

## Selecting a hero

The app now displays a list of heroes as well as a single hero in the details view. But
the list and the details view are not connected.
When users select a hero from the list, the selected hero should appear in the details view.
This UI pattern is known as "master/detail."
In this case, the _master_ is the heroes list and the _detail_ is the selected hero.

Next you'll connect the master to the detail through a `selected` component property,
which is bound to a click event.

### Handle click events

Add a click event binding to the `<li>` like this:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html (click)" region="" retain="/\bli\b|span|click/" title?>
```
  <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes"
      (click)="onSelect(hero)">
    <span class="badge">{!{hero.id}!}</span> {!{hero.name}!}
  </li>
```

The parentheses identify the `<li>` element's  `click` event as the target.
The `onSelect(hero)` expression calls the  `AppComponent` method, `onSelect()`,
passing the template input variable `hero`, as an argument.
That's the same `hero` variable you defined previously in the `ngFor` directive.

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  Learn more about event binding at the
  [User Input](../guide/user-input) page and the
  [Event binding](../guide/template-syntax#event-binding) section of the
  [Template Syntax](../guide/template-syntax) page.
</div>

### Add a click handler to expose the selected hero

You no longer need the `hero` property because you're no longer displaying a single hero; you're displaying a list of heroes.
But the user will be able to select one of the heroes by clicking on it.
So replace the `hero` property with this simple `selected` property:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.dart (selected)" title?>
```
  Hero selected;
```

The hero names should all be unselected before the user picks a hero, so
you won't initialize the `selected` as you did with `hero`.

Add an `onSelect()` method that sets the `selected` property to the `hero` that the user clicks.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.dart (onSelect)" title?>
```
  void onSelect(Hero hero) => selected = hero;
```

The template still refers to the old `hero` property.
Bind to the new `selected` property instead as follows:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html" remove="/^[^\s]|hero|li/" title?>
```
  <h2>{!{selected.name}!}</h2>
  <div><label>id: </label>{!{selected.id}!}</div>
  <div>
    <label>name: </label>
    <input [(ngModel)]="selected.name" placeholder="name">
  </div>
```

### Hide the empty detail with ngIf

When the app loads, `selected` is null.
The selected hero is initialized when the user clicks a hero's name.
Angular can't display properties of the null `selected` and throws the following error,
visible in the browser's console:

```nocode
  EXCEPTION: TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined in [null]
```

Although `selected.name` is displayed in the template,
you must keep the hero detail out of the DOM until there is a selected hero.

Wrap the HTML hero detail content of the template with a `<div>`.
Then add the `ngIf` core directive and set it to `selected != null`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html" remove="/\b(h1|[Hh]ero|li|ul)/" title?>
```
  <div *ngIf="selected != null">
    <h2>{!{selected.name}!}</h2>
    <div><label>id: </label>{!{selected.id}!}</div>
    <div>
      <label>name: </label>
      <input [(ngModel)]="selected.name" placeholder="name">
    </div>
  </div>
```

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  Don't forget the asterisk (`*`) in front of `ngIf`.
</div>

<i class="material-icons">open_in_browser</i>
**Refresh the browser.** The app no longer fails and the list of names displays again in the browser.

When there is no selected hero, the `ngIf` directive removes the hero detail HTML from the DOM.
There are no hero detail elements or bindings to worry about.

When the user picks a hero, `selected` becomes non-null and
`ngIf` puts the hero detail content into the DOM and evaluates the nested bindings.

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  Read more about `ngIf` and `ngFor` in the
  [Structural Directives](../guide/structural-directives) page and the
  [Built-in directives](../guide/template-syntax#directives) section of the
  [Template Syntax](../guide/template-syntax) page.
</div>


### Style the selected hero

While the selected hero details appear below the list, it's difficult to identify the selected hero within the list itself.

In the `styles` metadata that you added above, there is a custom CSS class named `selected`.
To make the selected hero more visible, you'll apply this `selected` class to the `<li>` when the user clicks on a hero name.
For example, when the user clicks "Magneta", it should render with a distinctive but subtle background color
like this:

<img class="image-display" src="{% asset ng/devguide/toh/heroes-list-selected.png @path %}" alt="Selected hero">

In the template, add the following binding to  the `<li>` tag:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html" retain="class.selected"?>
```
  [class.selected]="hero === selected"
```

When the expression (`hero === selected`) is `true`, Angular adds the `selected` CSS class.
When the expression is `false`, Angular removes the `selected` class.


<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  The `===` operator tests whether the given objects are [identical][].

  Read more about the `[class]` binding in the [Template Syntax](../guide/template-syntax#ngClass "Template syntax: NgClass") guide.
</div>

The final version of the `<li>` looks like this:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component.html" retain="/li|span|hero\b/" title?>
```
  <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes"
      [class.selected]="hero === selected"
      (click)="onSelect(hero)">
    <span class="badge">{!{hero.id}!}</span> {!{hero.name}!}
  </li>
```

After clicking "Magneta", the list should look like this:

<img class="image-display" src="{% asset ng/devguide/toh/heroes-list-1.png @path %}" alt="Output of heroes list app" width="320px">

## Review the app structure

Your project should have the following files:

<div class="ul-filetree" markdown="1">
- angular_tour_of_heroes
  - lib
    - app_component.{css,dart,html}
    - src
      - hero.dart
      - mock_heroes.dart
  - test
    - app_test.dart
    - ...
  - web
    - index.html
    - main.dart
    - styles.css
  - analysis_options.yaml
  - pubspec.yaml
</div>

## The road you've travelled

Here's what you achieved in this page:

* The Tour of Heroes app displays a list of selectable heroes.
* You moved the app template into its own file.
* You moved the `Hero` class under `lib/src`.
* You added the ability to select a hero and show the hero's details.
* You learned how to use the core directives `ngIf` and `ngFor` in a component's template.
* You defined styles in a CSS file and made used them to style the app.

Your app should look like this {% example_ref %}.

## The road ahead

You've expanded the Tour of Heroes app, but it's far from complete.
An app shouldn't be one monolithic component.
In the [next page](toh-pt3), you'll split the app into subcomponents and make them work together.
